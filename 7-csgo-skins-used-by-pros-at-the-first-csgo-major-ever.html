  Brief Overview of a CS:GO Major Event
 </strong>
<span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 This is where it all began! DreamHack Winter 2013 was the biggest CS tournament at the time and the first-ever CS:GO Major event. It was an S-Tier LAN event with a $250,000 prize pool held in Jönköping, Sweden. Sixteen teams participated in the tournament: ten of them received direct invitations, and the others had to qualify.
</p>
<p>
 The Swedish team fnatic became the champions of the first CS:GO Major tournament ever, but they are not the only players who made highlights in the matches. Let’s do a little recap by watching the historical highlights and also find out what CS:GO skins players used at the first CS:GO Major.
</p>

<p>
 In their opening BO1 match in Group B, Kenny “kennyS” Schrub and his team Recursive lost to Ninjas in Pyjamas on Inferno with a 13:16 score. However, the French sniper stood out by hitting an amazing highlight.

<p>
 kennyS played aggressively with his AWP | Graphite on Mid and successfully took out four enemy players trying to push the chokepoint. Although Recursive lost the match, kennyS finished the map with a 1.18 Rating and was acknowledged as the best player of the match.

  AWP | Graphite
 </a>
 is a Classified sniper rifle skin released as a part of the Bravo Collection in September, 2013. Described as “a memento from Agency”, this skin has a chrome base coat complemented by a geometric pattern applied with metallic paints. It resembles polygons, and different parts of the weapon’s body have different levels of reflectiveness.
</p>
<p>
 This weapon’s finish style is Anodized Multicolored. If you’re not sure what it means, read our article covering

 and how they differ.
</p>
<p>
 AWP | Graphite is only available in Factory New and Minimal Wear conditions, and their price is almost the same – around $200. If you want a StatTrak™ version of this skin, get ready to pay double the price.

 LGB esports started their run in the DreamHack Winter 2013 Playoffs with a BO3 against Ninjas in Pyjamas. Although LGB could not secure its spot in the Semi-finals, losing 1:2 to another Swedish team, Olof ‘olofmeister’ Kajbjer made his mark with a triple-kill on Dust 2.

 The Mil-Spec

  AK-47 | Black Laminate

 is one of the oldest skins in CS:GO. It was released within the Vertigo Collection that was brought by The Arms Deal Update in August, 2013. The wooden parts of the weapon were given a laminate stock which resulted in a beige and gray wavy pattern.
</p>
<p>
 The prices of this AK-47 skin vary. It sells for $30 in Battle-Scarred condition and for $36 in Minimal Wear. However, Factory New variants cost around $115.

 ACE time! In Group C, VeryGames faced n!faculty in a BO1 fight for a spot in the DreamHack Winter 2013 Playoffs. They beat the Norwegian team scoring 16:9 on Dust 2, and advanced to the next stage. Richard ‘shox’ Papillon hit an ace in one of the rounds, and it was acknowledged as one of the best highlights of the tournament.

 shox opened A by coming out from Short and taking out two CT defenders. He pushed the site with his team and placed the C4. His teammates died, and the French player was left 1 vs. 3, but he managed to score the round. 5 enemies, 5 frags, 5 headshots – perfect ace with AK-47 | Case Hardened.

</p>
<p>

 On T-side, Xyp9x was trying to enter the B site, and he opened the round with a frag on B Short. Then, the Danish player took down the defending sniper near the Forest and planted the bomb. In a matter of seconds, he killed the remaining CT players and secured an ace with an
