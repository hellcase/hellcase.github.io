Here are a few key reasons:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   Condition\n  </strong>\n  : CS:GO gloves come in various conditions ranging from Battle-Scarred to Factory New. Gloves in better condition are often more expensive, while those in worse condition tend to be cheaper.\n </li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   Rarity and Supply\n  </strong>\n  : Among the main determinants of glove price in CS:GO is its rarity and the supply-demand ratio. More common gloves are cheaper due to their higher supply, and rarer items cost more.\n </li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   Case Availability\n  </strong>\n  : Gloves are obtained from opening specific glove cases. If a case containing certain gloves is no longer dropping in the game, the gloves can become more expensive due to limited supply. On the other hand, gloves from cases that are widely available tend to be cheaper.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n In addition, it is worth pointing out that another key factor to consider when in the market for cheap CS:GO gloves is the platform on which they are sold. Prices of CS:GO gloves tend to be higher on the\n <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Steam Community Market\n </a>\n because Steam users are unable to withdraw their money.
