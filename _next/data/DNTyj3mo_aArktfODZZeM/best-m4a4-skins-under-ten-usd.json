If you prefer the silenced variant of this rifle, explore the best M4A1-S skins under $10.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<em>\n   “More accurate but less damaging than its AK-47 counterpart, the M4A4 is the full-auto assault rifle of choice for CTs.”\n  </em>\n</p>\n<cite>\n  ― Valve.\n </cite>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n M4A4 is a great weapon for middle-range and long-range duels. This rifle offers decent accuracy and a moderate recoil that is easy to control. It is recommended to fire it in small bursts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Believe it or not, rumors say that equipping a nice-looking M4A4 skin increases your chances of defending a site by 50%. And, although CS:GO skins are purely cosmetic, they are sure to boost your confidence on the battlefield and make you stand out.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, are you ready to upgrade the looks of your assault rifle without breaking the bank? Here are the seven best M4A4 skins you can get for less than ten dollars.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"M4A4_Desolate_Space\">\n</span>\n M4A4 | Desolate Space\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n “We’ve lost contact”.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n\n</figure>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Rarity: Classified\n </li>\n<li>\n  Finish Style: Custom Paint Job\n </li>\n<li>\n  Float value range: 0.00 to 1.00\n </li>\n<li>\n  StatTrak™ is available: yes\n </li>\n<li>\n  Starting price: $4.97\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n M4A4 | Desolate Space is a community-made weapon finish designed by DryDoctorEgg and Andy.
