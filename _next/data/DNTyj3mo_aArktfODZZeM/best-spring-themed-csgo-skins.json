It is a community-created weapon finish made by iamrexar.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a great CS:GO skin to welcome the season of renewal! The pattern that complements the Sawed-Off’s receiver consists of white lilies and green leaves. The color palette of this shotgun skin is pretty pale, but it surely suits the early days of spring spirit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sawed-Off | Morris in a Factory New condition with a StatTrak™ feature costs only $1. If you want a darker finish, go for higher float values. From Battle-Scarred to Field-Tested, this skin sells for $0.10.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Glock-18_Ironwork\">\n</span>\n Glock-18 | Ironwork\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n “Left unchecked, any garden becomes a tangled mass of weeds”.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Glock-18 Ironwork\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/A6CJmM54.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Rarity: Mil-Spec.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Finish Style: Patina.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Float value range: 0.00 to 1.00.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Starting price: $0.15.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n The Mil-Spec Glock-18 | Ironwork was designed by L’grand. Valve added this skin to CS:GO within the Glove Case released in March, 2019.\n</p>\n<p>\n While most of the pistol’s components remained untouched, its slide is embellished with etched patterns of ivy’s intertwining branches and leaves. Also, it has a “GLOCK 18” inscription engraved on top of the slide.\n</p>\n<p>\n This skin is available in all conditions. The Battle-Scarred variants of Glock-18 | Ironwork only cost $15, and Factory New ones sell for $1.10. You can get an FN StatTrak™ version of this pistol skin for $4.99.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"SSG_08_Spring_Twilly\">\n</span>\n SSG 08 | Spring Twilly\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n “Last chance; train’s leaving the station”.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"SSG 08 Spring Twilly\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/JLy7liZK.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Rarity: Mil-Spec.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Finish Style: Hydrographic.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Float value range: 0.00 to 0.55.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   StatTrak™ is available: no.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Starting price: $0.25.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n Added in September, 2021, SSG 08 | Spring Twilly is a part of The 2021 Train Collection. This is a Valve-made skin released alongside Operation Riptide’s start.\n</p>\n<p>\n Painted in black, white, and different hues of green, this skin is complemented with an abstract-styled hydrographic pattern detailed with icons, lightning bolts, and geometric forms. The back part of the sniper rifle’s buttstock is solid black, and its scope is mostly white.\n</p>\n<p>\n SSG 08 | Spring Twilly is a very cheap weapon finish, and it is available in all conditions. A Battle-Scarred variant sells for $0.30, but a Factory New skin will not hurt your wallet, as it’s only $0.95.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"AUG_Fleet_Flock\">\n</span>\n AUG | Fleet Flock\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n “Some birds represent harmony and peace… these are not those birds”.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AUG Fleet Flock\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/YviUiUjy.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Rarity: Classified.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Float value range: 0.00 to 1.00.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Starting price: $1.90.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n Created by PoignantEnvy, AUG | Fleet Flock was added to CS:GO as a part of the Chroma 3 Case at the end of April, 2016.\n</p>\n<p>\n This primarily dark blue AUG skin is complemented with clouds and swallows, the migratory birds which return home from the South every spring. Some of the gun’s components, such as the magazine, the barrel, and a part of the body, are painted in rainee color.\n</p>\n<p>\n AUG | Fleet Flock looks great in all conditions, including the lower floats of Battle-Scarred. You can get a Well-Worn skin for around $2, a Factory New variant will cost you $8.10. The lowest price for this skin with a StatTrak™ feature is $3.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Nova_Bloomstick\">\n</span>\n Nova | Bloomstick\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Nova Bloomstick\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/bFMaRR7m.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Rarity: Classified.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Float value range: 0.06 to 0.80.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Starting price: $5.30.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n The custom-painted\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Nova | Bloomstick\n </a>\n first appeared in CS:GO within the eSports 2014 Summer Collection that Valve added in July, 2014. This case is now discontinued.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the vibrant red base coat of the shotgun’s receiver and buttstock, an airbrushed cheery blossom motif was depicted. There are details like magnificent flowers with pink petals on the branches and leaves. The other components of the weapon are untouched.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Nova skin is available in all conditions, but it’s not worth getting Battle-Scarred and Well-Worn variants. If you really like this skin and you are ready to spend $75, go for a Factory New skin. A Minimal Wear variant looks decent as well: it will cost you around $15.\n</p>\n<p>\n Get your Nova | Bloomstick from the\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Classified Case\n </a>\n on <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"AK-47_Ice_Coaled\">\n</span>\n AK-47 | Ice Coaled\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n “Cold to the touch”.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AK-47 Ice Coaled\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/Ii2VXeJd.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n   Rarity: Classified.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Float value range: 0.00 to 0.77.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n  </li>\n<li>\n   Starting price: $10.53.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>\n Created by REINCARNATION,\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AK-47 | Ice Coaled\n </a>\n was released by Valve as a part of the Recoil Case in July, 2022.\n</p>\n<p>\n This AK-47 is complemented with a custom-painted gradient pattern in bright hues of green and blue.
