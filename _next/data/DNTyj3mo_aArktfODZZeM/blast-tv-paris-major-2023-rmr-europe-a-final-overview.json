Let’s look at who their opponents were and what difficulties they faced along the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the first day of the competition, Natus Vincere competed against Into The Breach on Inferno. Both teams closely contested the match for 41 rounds. Eventually, NAVI emerged victorious with a score of 22:19.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is the\n \n  highlight of the map\n \n .\n</p>\n<p>\n The next opponent for NAVI was Falcons, and they faced off on Ancient.

They played a Bo3 series, and, and NAVI won two maps. The first map was Inferno, which NAVI won with a score of 16:7, and the second map was Ancient, which NAVI secured with a score of 16:11.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is the\n \n  highlight of the maps.\n \n</p>\n<p>\n Natus Vincere set a record by participating in all CS:GO Major events that ever took place. In addition, no other team will ever be able to surpass this record, as Counter-Strike 2 launches this summer, and BLAST.tv Paris Major is the last CS:GO Major in the history of the series.
