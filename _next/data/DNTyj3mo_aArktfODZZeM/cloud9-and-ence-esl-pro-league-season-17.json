Over the past three months, they have played seven times on this map and have a 60% win rate.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the first half, the fight was even. However, Cloud9 struggled on CT side and won 9 out of 15 rounds on defense. But then something went wrong. After switching sides, MOUZ easily crushed Cloud9.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, the teams got the following results:\n</p>\n<p>\n Cloud9 â€“ 10 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n MOUZ â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"The_second_map\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  The second map\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Cloud9 chose Vertigo, with a 100% win rate for the last three months.\n</p>\n<p>\n It mirrored the situation with the first map. In the first half, the score was almost equal.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the second half of the map, Cloud9 took a defensive position and successfully won most of the rounds. Cloud9 was able to hold on and see the match through after some extremely tense rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The result of the second map:\n</p>\n<p>\n Cloud9 â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n MOUZ â€“ 11 rounds.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"The_third_map\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  The third map\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n The third map was crucial for the teams.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cloud9 made a confident start at Mirage and managed to defeat their opponents with a score of 16-10 to close their series.\n</p>\n<p>\n The third map ended with Cloud9â€™s victory:\n</p>\n<p>\n Cloud9 â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n MOUZ â€“ 10 rounds.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cloud9 vs Mouz played Inferno, Vertigo, and Mirage\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"686\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/y1GWQVA8.jpeg\" width=\"900\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n The meeting ended in a victory for Cloud9.\n \n  Sergey â€˜Ax1Leâ€™ Rykhtorov\n \n played his heart out.

Thatâ€™s why both teams play this map quite well.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the first half of the map, ENCE played for the terrorists, but Vitality kept the defense well and acted in a coordinated manner. After a series of unsuccessful attacks, ENCE called a timeout. They changed their strategy and won several rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the beginning of the second half of the match, the results were 10-5 with Vitalityâ€™s advantage. ENCE won several rounds in a row on defense. But the Vitality team proved to be stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\n ENCE â€“ 14 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Vitality â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"The_second_map-2\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  The second map\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Overpass was the second map, and according to statistics, ENCE had a better chance of winning. And so it happened. ENCE was able to defeat their opponents with an easy 13-2 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n The game was gaining momentum. It seemed as though Vitality had woken up and come back to play. But it was very difficult to change such a large difference in rounds. ENCE won 3 rounds on T side.\n</p>\n<p>\n ENCE â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Vitality â€“ 11 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second map ended with ENCE winning.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"The_third_map-2\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  The third map\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n This is a very difficult map for both teams. Therefore, the chances are equal.\n</p>\n<p>\n The teams were neck and neck. The teams were neck and neck. No one gave away more than two rounds in a row. But after the seventh round, Vitality managed to win most of the rounds and the first half ended with a score of 9-6 in favor of Vitality.\n</p>\n<p>\n After switching sides, ENCE started to win round after round.\n</p>\n<p>\n Vitality managed to stop their opponents and won 5 more rounds, but ENCE proved to be stronger and took the victory with a score of 16-14.\n</p>\n<p>\n ENCE â€“ 16 rounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Vitality â€“ 14 rounds.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"ENCE and Vitality fighting on Nuke, Overpass, and Vertigo\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"677\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/ERWJVDAJ.png\" width=\"854\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n The best player of the match was\n \n  Mathieu â€˜ZywOoâ€™ Herbaut (Vitality)\n \n , who made 70 kills on three maps and had a KD of 1.25.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Highlights_Cloud9_vs_MOUZ\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Highlights Cloud9 vs MOUZ\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The first clutch moment was when the MOUZ team won the round with full eco.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    The FULL ECO 2nd round win\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mousesports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @mousesports\n    </a>\n    ðŸ˜³\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESLProLeague?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #ESLProLeague\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/GxpjLeDndL\n    \n</p>\n   â€” ESL Counter-Strike 2 (@ESLCS)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/1638919260624805889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 23, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n The team with only a Glock-18 won the round.\n</p>\n<p>\n Frozen was able to protect the bomb and won the round.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    .\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FROZENNcs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @FROZENNcs\n    </a>\n    CLUTCHES 1v3 to win the force buy ðŸ¥¶\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ESLProLeague?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #ESLProLeague\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/8SH5ffCTQH\n    \n</p>\n   â€” ESL Counter-Strike 2 (@ESLCS)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/1638923926079258627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 23, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Left alone on the A-side, he won round one against three, with 29 HP and an\n <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AK-47\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n Highlight by Hobbit.
