The most common use for patches is to fix different bugs and exploits. Simply put, CS:GO updates bring the new stuff into the game and fix the old stuff. This includes balance changes, gameplay fixes, map rotation, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n Developers keep track of all the updates they release. You can find the&nbsp;CS:GO update log, including both the oldest and the&nbsp;latest CS:GO update&nbsp;on the game’s official website.\n</p>\n<p>\n To play the game, you need to make sure you have the&nbsp;CS:GO’s newest update&nbsp;installed on your device, whether it is a PC or a Steam Deck. Otherwise, you will not be able to simply run it. To see if you have&nbsp;CS:GO’s new patch&nbsp;that needs to be installed, check your Steam app.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Frequency_of_CS_GO_Updates_in_a_Year\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Frequency of CS:GO Updates in a Year\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n In 2022, Valve released thirty-one major and minor&nbsp;CS:GO patches.
