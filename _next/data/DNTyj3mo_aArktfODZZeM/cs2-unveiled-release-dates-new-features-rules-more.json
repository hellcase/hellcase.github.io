Counter-Strike 2, the CS:GO killer, is real and coming in the Summer of 2023. Valve announced that in a few months, they would finally release the long-awaited update to begin a new era of Counter-Strike. Also, they let the fans take a peek behind the scenes and revealed some of the future features.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Courtesy: Valve\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"467\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/1dCwhUUU.png\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n   Courtesy: Valve\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n On March 22, developers revealed that Source 2 is coming and Counter-Strike 2 is the biggest technical leap in the series’ history. They released a\n \n  website\n \n covering the newest features and the Limited Test F.A.Q.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Today we're excited to announce Counter-Strike 2. Counter-Strike 2 is an overhaul to every system, every piece of content, and every part of the C-S experience. First, let's talk about smoke grenades:\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/iTtguRHJ0S\n    \n</p>\n   — CS2 (@CounterStrike)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1638580074126659584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 22, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n First things first, the smoke grenade mechanics are completely reworked. In Counter-Strike 2, they are “dynamic volumetric objects that interact with the environment and react to lighting, gunfire, and explosions”. Smokes are now responsive, meaning you will be able to push smoke to briefly clear sightlines or expand occlusion.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_y9MpNcAitQ?feature=oembed\" title=\"Counter-Strike 2: Responsive Smokes\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Has anybody seen the tick rate? Oops, it’s gone, just your opportunity to blame server lags for missing your shots. Tick rate no longer matters for moving, shooting, or throwing as Counter-Strike 2 presents a sub-tick update architecture. You can learn more about it in the video Valve published on their official YouTube channel.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqhhFl5zgA0?feature=oembed\" title=\"Counter-Strike 2: Moving Beyond Tick Rate\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n In Counter-Strike 2, maps are reinvented to make the in-game world cleaner, brighter, and simply better.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExZtISgOxEQ?feature=oembed\" title=\"Counter-Strike 2: Leveling Up The World\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Every map in Counter-Strike 2 falls under one of three categories: touchstone maps, upgraded maps, and fully overhauled ones. The first ones, like de_dust2, have not changed apart from getting improvements to lighting and character reading.\n</p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\">\n<div>\n<p>\n   In article you will find:\n  </p>\n<span>\n</span>\n</div>\n<nav>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Lets_Have_a_Closer_Look\" title=\"Let’s Have a Closer Look\">\n     Let’s Have a Closer Look\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Lets_See_the_Gameplay_Visuals\" title=\"Let’s See the Gameplay Visuals\">\n     Let’s See the Gameplay Visuals\n    </a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Lets_Have_a_Closer_Look\">\n</span>\n Let’s Have a Closer Look\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Here is the old Back Plat on Dust 2.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\" old Back Plat on Dust 2.\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"620\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/5lZ0uzYY.jpeg\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n   Courtesy: Valve\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n And here is how it looks on the touched-up map we will try out in Counter-Strike 2.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"New  Back Plat on Dust 2\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"620\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/nK6a8EqA.jpeg\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n   Courtesy: Valve\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Upgraded maps, like Nuke, use new Source 2 lighting, including a physically based rendering system that produces realistic materials, lighting, and reflections.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s a screenshot of the old A site we’re used to seeing in CS:GO.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"old A site Nuke\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"620\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/Xx898cUm.jpeg\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n   Courtesy: Valve\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n And here is how Nuke’s A Site looks reworked with the new lightning and rendering effects.

In addition, the models of all stock weapons have been upgraded with high-resolution models.\n</p>\n<p>\n Apart from other changes, the new audio system is coming.
