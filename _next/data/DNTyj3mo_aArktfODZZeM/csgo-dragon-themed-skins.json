According to beliefs, these mythical creatures bring good luck and prosperity to those who honor them.\n</p>\n<p>\n During Chinese New Year celebrations, it is common to see dragon dances, for which performers dress up in dragon costumes and perform acrobatic feats to chase away evil. The dragon is also a common motif in decorations and other celebration elements.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"main Dragon-Themed Skins\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/n9ldjIpr.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Dragon-themed skins are popular among the CS:GO community as six of the dragon-themed skins we found are community-made.

This skin is from The Bravo Collection, released upon Operation Bravo’s start in September, 2013.\n</p>\n<p>\n Described as\n <em>\n  “a memento from Chinatown”\n </em>\n , this P90 has a custom-painted dragon and gray clouds on its body. The color palette used to depict the mythical creature is green, yellow, white, and blue. The magazine and the muzzle of the SMG are untouched.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"SSG_08_Dragonfire\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  SSG 08 | Dragonfire\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “Sit on your horde and wait for any who come to take it.”\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"SSG-08-Dragonfire\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/MkI6lFgw.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Rarity:\n </strong>\n Covert\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Finish Style:\n </strong>\n Custom Paint Job\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Float value range:\n </strong>\n 0.00 to 0.50\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  StatTrak™:\n </strong>\n yes\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Price (FN):\n </strong>\n $22\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  SSG 08 | Dragonfire\n </a>\n is the last community-made skin here. Created by Helenek and Puffin (•⌔• ), it was introduced to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive within The Glove Collection in November, 2016. The dragon depicted on this SSG 08 is much more realistic than the ones you saw on previous skins, and it snorts fire!\n</p>\n<p>\n The color palette of&nbsp;SSG 08 | Dragonfire&nbsp;includes multiple shades of orange, gray, and blue. You can spot geometric patterns on the barrel of the sniper rifle.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AWP_Dragon_Lore\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Dragon Lore\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “200 keys could never unlock its secrets.”\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"SAWP-Dragon-Lore\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/DQQR7Ier.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Rarity:\n </strong>\n Covert\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Finish Style:\n </strong>\n Custom Paint Job\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Float value range:\n </strong>\n 0.00 to 0.70\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  StatTrak™:\n </strong>\n no\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Price (FN):\n </strong>\n $10,000\n</p>\n<p>\n We saved this one for dessert.\n <a href=\"https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AWP | Dragon Lore\n </a>\n is one of the rarest and most expensive skins. It was released as a part of The Cobblestone Collection in July, 2014.\n</p>\n<p>\n Four years later, Valve removed Cobblestone from the Active Duty map pool, meaning containers with this skin would no longer drop. However, you can still purchase this legendary AWP skin on the market.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Dragon Lore\n </strong>\n is a custom-painted skin. The olive-painted AWP is decorated with a knotwork dragon spitting fire. Looking closely, you will spot Celtic ornaments on the dragon’s body. The sniper rifle’s scope, the barrel, and the back part of the buttstock feature a checkered pattern in black and green.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"To_Wrap_Up\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  To Wrap Up!\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Well, we hope we didn’t miss anything.
