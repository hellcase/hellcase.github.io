In the first part, we gathered all the CS:GO skins with dragons.\n</p>\n<p>\n Reptiles are a diverse group of cold-blooded animals that includes snakes, lizards, and crocodiles. Each species possesses a unique set of characteristics and behaviors that make each of them as fascinating as they are deadly. Snakes are masters of stealth and precision hunting due to their elongated bodies and flexible jaws.\n</p>\n<p>\n With their colorful skin and agile movements, lizards are the ultimate opportunists, able to climb, swim, and run with equal skill. And crocodiles, with their ancient, dinosaur-like appearance and raw power, are the ultimate apex predator.\n</p>\n<p>\n We will cover eight CS:GO skins with reptiles. With these skins equipped, your chances of surviving in the jungle forests will undoubtedly increase (especially in Ancient).\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s the list of the best reptile-themed skins for CS:GO weapons:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  AWP | Snake Camo\n </li>\n<li>\n  AWP | Atheris\n </li>\n<li>\n  XM1014 | Incinegator\n </li>\n<li>\n  USP-S | Caiman\n </li>\n<li>\n  P250 | See Ya Later\n </li>\n<li>\n  AUG | Chameleon\n </li>\n<li>\n  M4A1-S | Welcome to the Jungle\n </li>\n<li>\n  AWP | Desert Hydra.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n We could not find any skins for knives to put here, but we included Broken Fang Gloves and Hydra Gloves as well as two other skins for gloves on our list.
