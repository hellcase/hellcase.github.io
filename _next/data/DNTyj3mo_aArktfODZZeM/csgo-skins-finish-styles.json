As Valve states, the recipe for creating a skin is simple: all you need is a weapon and an idea of how to decorate it.\n</p>\n<p>\n However, to create a skin you must also decide on a finish style for your future masterpiece. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive offers community skin creators a range of finish styles, each representing a particular finishing technique. We will go over nine finish styles for skins in this article.\n</p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\">\n<div>\n<p>\n   In article you will find:\n  </p>\n<span>\n</span>\n</div>\n<nav>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#What_are_Finish_Styles\" title=\"What are Finish Styles?\">\n     What are Finish Styles?\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Solid_color\" title=\"Solid color\">\n     Solid color\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Spray_Paint\" title=\"Spray Paint\">\n     Spray Paint\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Hydrographic\" title=\"Hydrographic\">\n     Hydrographic\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Anodized\" title=\"Anodized\">\n     Anodized\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Anodized_Airbrushed\" title=\"Anodized Airbrushed\">\n     Anodized Airbrushed\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Anodized_Multicolored\" title=\"Anodized Multicolored\">\n     Anodized Multicolored\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Patina\" title=\"Patina\">\n     Patina\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Custom_Paint_Job\" title=\"Custom Paint Job\">\n     Custom Paint Job\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Gunsmith\" title=\"Gunsmith\">\n     Gunsmith\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#To_Wrap_Up\" title=\"To Wrap Up!\">\n     To Wrap Up!\n    </a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"What_are_Finish_Styles\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  What are Finish Styles?\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Among all the parameters of CS:GO skins, finish style determines how a float value impacts the looks of the skin. Let’s first speak about seven styles that cause skins to age similarly. These are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Solid Color\n </li>\n<li>\n  Spray Paint\n </li>\n<li>\n  Hydrographic\n </li>\n<li>\n  Anodized\n </li>\n<li>\n  Anodized Airbrushed\n </li>\n<li>\n  Anodized Multicolored\n </li>\n<li>\n  Custom Paint Job.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n As the wear level rises, portions of a paint layer are “scrubbed off” of skins with finish styles from this group.\n</p>\n<p>\n Unlike them,\n <strong>\n  Patina\n </strong>\n skins age by either changing color or losing saturation.\n <strong>\n  Gunsmith\n </strong>\n finish style, on the other hand, simply causes the skin to darken as its float value increases.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you are creating CS:GO skins, finish style choice matters. From Solid Color to Gunsmith, we will cover all nine of them and show you examples of CS:GO skins in each style.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Solid_color\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Solid color\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Let’s start with Solid Color. Weapon skins with this finish style can feature up to four different colors in their parts are painted in. Keep in mind that it is impossible to add any patterns or applications to Solid Color skins.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"solid color finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/QfH0vg23.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Solid Color finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    MP7 | Whiteout\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    SG 553 | Ultraviolet\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Glock-18 | Candy Apple\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Not much to say here,\n <strong>\n  MP7 | Whiteout\n </strong>\n is painted solid white. It looks sharp in Factory New condition, while Well-Worn skin has almost half of its paint exfoliated.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  SG 553 | Ultraviolet\n </strong>\n appeared in the game among the first-ever skins in the\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  CS:GO Weapon Case\n </a>\n . Every part of the weapon, except its black body and magazine, is deep purple.\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n <strong>\n  Glock-18 | Candy Apple\n </strong>\n ‘s crimson slide and black body are a killer combo. Simple guns, like Glock-18, suit simple designs.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Spray_Paint\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Spray Paint\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n If you want your skin to appear as though it was spray-painted through a stencil pattern, the Spray Paint finish style will work. Skins with this finish style can be embellished with some pattern, unlike those with Solid Color finish.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"spray paint finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/iWj6b4NS.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Spray Paint finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    M4A4 | Zirka\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Galil AR | Crimson Tsunami\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AWP | Safari Mesh\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n The center of the\n <strong>\n  M4A4 | Zirka\n </strong>\n ‘s body is decorated with a large yellow star on a khaki-colored background, with a chain design in the background. Fun fact: “zirka” is a Ukrainian word for “a star”.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Galil AR | Crimson Tsunami\n </strong>\n depicts a stormy sea scenery with enormous foamy waves ready to sweep over your enemies. Gray, beige and maroon color palette was a great choice for this skin.\n</p>\n<p>\n A military mesh and cardboard cutouts were used as stencils to spray-paint the body of the camouflage-styled\n <strong>\n  AWP | Safari Mesh\n </strong>\n with light green and khaki colors.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Hydrographic\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Hydrographic\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Looks just as cool as it sounds. Patterns are put on these skins by lowering parts of weapons through a floating hydrographic film on the surface of a water tank. When it’s done, the film sticks and covers the surface of the gun parts.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"hydrographic finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/qM2poUvR.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Hydrographic finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AWP | POP AWP\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    M4A1-S | Bright Water\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Desert Eagle | Crimson Web\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | POP AWP\n </strong>\n features a geometric techno-inspired pattern and various inscriptions in the cubic typeface. The skin is designed in retro style using a palette of black, white, red, purple, and blue.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  M4A1-S | Bright Water\n </strong>\n , a skin from the Bravo Collection, has a camouflage-styled hydrographic film applied to most parts of the rifle.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Crimson Web\n </strong>\n has a painted crimson red base coat decorated with a hydrographic pattern that resembles a spider web, unique for each skin. On top of that, a transparent semi-gloss coat is applied.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Anodized\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Anodized\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Anodizing is a process of electrochemical treatment given to metal surfaces. This increases the oxide layers’ durability, making the material more resistant to corrosion and wear. Although many materials that guns are made of cannot technically be anodized, the effect can be imitated. Anodized skins feature a chrome base and a vibrant candy coat on top.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"anodized finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/Qd1KYqut.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Anodized finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AUG | Anodized Navy\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    MAC-10 | Silver\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Five-SeveN | Anodized Gunmetal\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n There’s beauty in simplicity, and\n <strong>\n  AUG | Anodized Navy\n </strong>\n is here to prove it. The minimalistic design of this skin features a chrome base coated with navy anodized effect paint on top.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  MAC-10 | Silver\n </strong>\n and\n <strong>\n  Five-SeveN | Anodized Gunmetal\n </strong>\n also has chrome base coats. However, while the MAC-10 skin was painted in silver, gunmetal anodized effect paint was used for the latter.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Anodized_Airbrushed\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Anodized Airbrushed\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Skins with an Anodized Airbrushed finish style are created by using freehand airbrush painting techniques and various stencils. An airbrush is a tool that uses compressed air to atomize and spray paint or other liquids onto a surface. This technique allows you to create various effects, from detailed, fine lines to broad, soft gradients.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"anodized airbrushed finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/SQGFMXpT.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Anodized Airbrushed finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AWP | Fade\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Desert Eagle | Hypnotic\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Desert Eagle | Blaze\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Fade\n </strong>\n and\n <strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Blaze\n </strong>\n have a chrome base coat, and\n <strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Hypnotic\n </strong>\n has a pearl one. The body of the AWP is decorated with a gradient fill, the colors of which depend on the pattern index.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Hypnotic\n </strong>\n features a black circular pattern that looks like a hypnotic circle on top of the metallic paint. The placement and size of its pattern vary on every skin variant.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Blaze,\n </strong>\n the bad boy among the Anodized Airbrushed skins, depicts malicious yellow flames with orange outlines. Don’t burn your fingers!\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Anodized_Multicolored\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Anodized Multicolored\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Multicolored patterns, silk screening, and adherable stencils have entered the chat.

This skin has a white metallic body with bamboo sticks painted all over it and green accents on small parts of the gun.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Lightning Strike\n </strong>\n stands out among the other skins because of the astonishing purple paint covering the sniper rifle and the image of the lightning that strikes through its body.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  M4A1-S | Blue Phosphor\n </strong>\n features multiple layers of different shades of metallic blue paint applied in a way to create a cloudy pattern.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Patina\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Patina\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Patina is a thin layer that forms on metallic surfaces. It is created by applying chemicals or other substances to the metal’s surface to create a desired color or finish. Patina can also serve as a protective metal layer, helping prevent corrosion and wear. This finish style unites skins that have been oxidized, cold-blued, or given a forced patina.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"patina finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/gPjHE0U4.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Patina finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AK-47 | Case Hardened\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    M4A1-S | Basilisk\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    Desert Eagle | Hand Cannon\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Starting with a part of one of the oldest and the most famous skin families in CS:GO,\n <strong>\n  AK-47 | Case Hardened\n </strong>\n is, as surprising as it sounds, case-hardened. This is a process of wood charcoal being applied at high temperatures.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  M4A1-S | Basilisk\n </strong>\n speaks for itself: this skin features a giant basilisk, a mythical reptile from various European legends, etched on its unpainted body.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Hand Cannon\n </strong>\n is mostly made of brass and has been treated with an acid resulting in a patina layer of yellow and blue stains.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Custom_Paint_Job\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Custom Paint Job\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n This is where you can let your creativity off the leash.

This is one of the most popular finishes for CS:GO skins.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"custom paint job finish style\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/2j8ek4Wx.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Examples of CS:GO skins in Patina finish style:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    M4A1-S | Printstream\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AWP | Chromatic Aberration\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n    AK-47 | Legion of Anubis\n   </a>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  M4A1-S | Printstream\n </strong>\n has numerous pictograms, lettering, and inscriptions on the black and white assault rifle. This skin differs from the others because of the Pearlescent effect that makes the gun shimmer when looking at it from different angles.\n</p>\n<p>\n An eye-catchy\n <strong>\n  AWP | Chromatic Aberration\n </strong>\n is complemented with a pattern of zebra stripes in shades of pink and purple colors, icons, and pictograms.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AK-47 | Legion of Anubis\n </strong>\n features applied paintings of Egyptian gods Anubis and Ra, a head of a mummy, and a pharaoh.
