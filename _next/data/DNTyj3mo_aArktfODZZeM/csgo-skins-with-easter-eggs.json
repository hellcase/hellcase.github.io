Oftentimes, these hidden surprises are meant to be discovered by players and can be a nod to pop culture, inside jokes, or references to other games. Easter eggs enhance the gameplay experience by adding an element of fun, humor, or curiosity to the content.\n</p>\n<p>\n The term “easter egg” comes from the tradition of hiding easter eggs during Easter celebrations, where participants search for the hidden eggs as part of the festivities. Similarly, easter eggs in video games involve a sense of discovery and excitement for those players who uncover them.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"CS_GO_Skins_With_Easter_Eggs\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  CS:GO Skins With Easter Eggs\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Everyone loves easter eggs! In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, there are numerous easter eggs spread throughout the game, including those hidden in the designs of weapon skins. Some of the community artists who create CS:GO skins have shown a keen eye for detail that sets their work apart from the rest, and we have found ten awesome easter eggs. These skins can become quite popular amongst players and collectors alike, with some of them featuring\n <a href=\"#easter-cases\">\n  special easter cases\n </a>\n that contain exclusive items.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let’s take a closer look at some of the most interesting easter eggs you can find while inspecting CS:GO skins.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Galil_AR_Chatterbox\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Galil AR | Chatterbox\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “Some say that when you laugh, the world laughs with you…but when Chatterbox laughs, there are only screams”.\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Galil AR | Chatterbox\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/JsFzjz39.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Rarity: Covert.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n</p>\n<p>\n Float value range: 0.35 to 0.85.\n</p>\n<p>\n StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Starting price: $7.20.\n</p>\n<p>\n Created by EGO DEATH,\n <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Galil AR | Chatterbox\n </a>\n was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a part of The Chroma Collection in January 2015. The author covered some parts of the weapon with yellow paint and adorned the receiver with an image of a cartoon-styled white skull.\n</p>\n<p>\n Several easter eggs are hidden in the Galil AR | Chatterbox design. First, there is a “FEED ME” inscription on the back part of the receiver, you can spot it while inspecting the rifle. Also, with each bullet you fire, the skull opens its mouth, creating an illusion of being alive and chattering.\n</p>\n<p>\n No Factory New and Minimal Wear variants of\n <strong>\n  Galil AR | Chatterbox\n </strong>\n exist. The pricing for Battle-Scarred skins starts at $7.20, and for Field-Tested ones – at $92.45. The most expensive variant of this skin is StatTrak™ Field-Tested which sells for $220.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"R8_Revolver_Bone_Forged\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  R8 Revolver | Bone Forged\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “What lurks below”.\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"R8 Revolver | Bone Forged\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/6xTHfX3C.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Rarity: Mil-Spec.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finish Style: Gunsmith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Float value range: 0.00 to 0.60.\n</p>\n<p>\n StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Starting price: $0.10.\n</p>\n<p>\n Added to the game in the Prisma 2 Collection in 2020, R8 Revolver | Bone Forged was created by Mysterion and Blazer. The pistol has been custom painted with copper paint, distressed, and adorned with an ancient sea monster engraved motif.\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  R8 Revolver | Bone Forged\n </a>\n skin in CS:GO is a prime example of how attention to detail can elevate a design from ordinary to extraordinary. One such detail is the engraved inscription “HUNGRY” on each bullet. This seemingly small element adds a layer of depth and meaning to the overall aesthetic, making it a beautiful and standout feature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another interesting feature of this skin is that with a higher wear level, the body of the revolver turns dark blue.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Mil-Spec is extremely affordable, costing only $0.10 in Battle-Scarred condition and around $0.30 in Factory New condition.

While the metal components of the assault rifle are not painted, the authors engraved them with motifs of flowers, stylized skulls, and snakes and coated them with a layer of patina.\n</p>\n<p>\n Quite a few easter eggs are hidden within the design of the AK-47 | Cartel. First of all, there is a symbol resembling an Illuminati sign engraved on the front sight component of the rifle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, there is an inscription that says “Hasta Siempre”. It is a reference to a song called “Hasta Siempre, Comandante”, which is a reply to revolutionary Che Guevara’s farewell letter when he left Cuba and was killed. The name of the song translates as “Until Forever, Commander”.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pricing of the basic variants of Patina-styled\n <strong>\n  АК-47 | Cartel\n </strong>\n vary from $9.95 for Battle-Scarred condition to almost $40 for Factory New condition. StatTrak™ Factory New AK-47 Cartel costs $100, but you can get it for $ only from our Case.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AWP_Capillary\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Capillary\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “The key to an agent’s heart costs $4750”.\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AWP | Capillary\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/bxXpYUzp.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Rarity: Mil-Spec.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n</p>\n<p>\n Float value range: 0.05 to 0.70.\n</p>\n<p>\n StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Starting price: $0.35.\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AWP | Capillary\n </a>\n was added to The Prisma 2 Collection in March 2020, and the skin was designed by M03H. The rifle’s body features a dark gray hue, enhanced by a transparent geometric pattern of thin parallel lines. A decorative pattern of intertwined teal and coral veins embellishes the background.\n</p>\n<p>\n While this AWP skin is extremely popular due to its eye-catching design and affordability, not all its owners know that an easter egg is hidden in the design. When you reload your sniper rifle, watch for a heart motif painted on the magazine.\n</p>\n<p>\n Battle-Scared variants of AWP | Capillary cost $0.35, and Factory New ones sell for $3.65. Pricing of StatTrak™ skins ranges from $1.70 to $13.50.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AK-47_Wasteland_Rebel\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  AK-47 | Wasteland Rebel\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “One day they will ask why we fight, and when they do they will understand – Naomi, Bodyguard to Valeria Jenner”.\n </em>\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AK-47 | Wasteland Rebel\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/ReEY3UNf.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Rarity: Covert.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finish Style: Custom Paint Job.\n</p>\n<p>\n Float value range: 0.05 to 0.70.\n</p>\n<p>\n StatTrak™ is available: yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Starting price: $50.\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n  AK-47 | Wasteland Rebel\n </a>\n made its debut in CS:GO in November 2014 as a part of The Vanguard Collection. This unique skin was crafted by SA_22. A graffiti-style white inscription “1337 Krew” embellishes the receiver, while a portion of the terrorists’ emblem is artistically hand-painted onto the magazine.\n</p>\n<p>\n The overall design is accentuated by small, hand-drawn details, including skulls, a smiley face, and a sequence of numbers “7355608” representing the bomb code. It is a small but great detail.

It is actually hidden in the flavor text which says “Mine.” The name of the MAG-7 | Seabird skin appears to be a clear nod to Pixar’s Finding Nemo.

Mine!”.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3fovcwvPtM?feature=oembed\" title=\"Finding Nemo: Mine!

This striking and creative illustration adds an eye-catching element to the weapon’s appearance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just like with MAG-7 | Seabird, the easter egg of XM1014 | Incinegator is hidden within its flavor text, “Boom. Bam. Bop… Pow.” It is a nod to a popular video of a rap battle parody that became a meme.
