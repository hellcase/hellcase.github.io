Like skins, they not only change the appearance of the items but also have different attributes such as rarity and material.\n</p>\n<p>\n You can’t increase the float value of your weapon skins, but you can do that with applied stickers: just scratch them, and they will look more worn. Also, scratching stickers is the only way to remove them from your gun. Note that it can not be restored or re-applied once you remove the sticker. Before the final scratch, the game will notify you that you will remove the sticker forever if you continue.\n</p>\n<p>\n So far, Valve has released five separate CS:GO stickers and four sticker capsules dedicated to five other games:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  DOTA 2.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Half-Life: Alyx.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Halo.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Battlefield 2042.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Warhammer 40,000.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n That’s a total of stickers in x unique designs.

It was released in 2011 as a sequel to Defense of the Ancient, a mod initially created for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.\n</p>\n<p>\n Even if you have never played the game, you must have heard about The International, the DOTA 2 world championship. The prize pool of this event in 2021 was $40,018,195, breaking the world record. As of now, eight TI events are in the top 10 of the\n \n  Largest\n \n\n  Overall\n \n\n  Prize Pools in Esports ranking.\n \n</p>\n<p>\n DOTA 2 is a game of strategic thinking, teamwork, and skill, where every match is a new adventure like no other. With a constantly changing meta and new heroes being added to the game, it offers an endless amount of strategies and tactics to master.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Steam Workshop, a collection of CS:GO stickers inspired by DOTA 2 appeared in October, 2014. TheDanidem and Zaphk created it. Valve eventually added five of these stickers to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://4stake.win/zjXD3xwt.jpeg\" width=\"868\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n List of DOTA 2-themed CS:GO stickers:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Doomed – $1.10.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Queen Of Pain – $1.10.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Piece of Cake – $1.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Witchcraft – $1.10.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Phoenix (Foil) – $5.50.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n All of these stickers are High Grade.\n <strong>\n  Doomed\n </strong>\n and\n <strong>\n  Queen of Pain\n </strong>\n were added to the game as a part of the Community Stickers Halloween 2014, then\n <strong>\n  Piece Of Cake\n </strong>\n and\n <strong>\n  Phoenix (Foil)\n </strong>\n were released in Community Stickers Series 3 a month later.
