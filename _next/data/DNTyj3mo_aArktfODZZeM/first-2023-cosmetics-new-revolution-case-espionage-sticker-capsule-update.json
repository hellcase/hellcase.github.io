Let’s take a look inside the new containers.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Revolution Weapon Case, the Espionage Sticker Capsule, and the Denzel Curry ULTIMATE Music Kit. \" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/pYyB76rr.jpeg\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n<strong>\n    Source:\n   </strong>\n   https://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2023/02/41047/\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n It has been a bit more than half of a year since the release of the Recoil Case in July 2022, so no wonder CS:GO players were craving new weapon skins and stickers.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Revolution Weapon Case includes seventeen fresh community-made finishes and skins for gloves from the Clutch Case as Rare Special Items. The most notable skins from the newest case are AK-47 | Head Shot, M4A4 | Temukau, and AWP | Doodle Lore.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cyberpunk and anime aesthetics appear to have been a source of inspiration for the skins that Valve included in the new case. This container is filled with futuristic and anime-themed patterns performed in vivid colors. We have already picked the ten best skins from this weapon case and shared the gems in our article.\n</p>\n<p>\n The developers also shipped the Espionage Sticker Capsule, which contains twenty-one stickers, each in a unique design hand-picked from the Steam Workshop submissions.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Espionage Sticker Capsule\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/HKmZCoPn.jpeg\" width=\"1024\">\n<figcaption>\n<strong>\n    Source:\n   </strong>\n   https://twitter.com/CSGO/status/1623861492943851520/photo/2\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n The capsule costs $0.99, and you do not need a key to open it. There are some attention-worthy stickers, such as Hidden Hero (Foil), Ethereal Gaze (Foil), and Infinite Triangle (Holo). Go ahead and get these pieces to adorn your weapons with!\n</p>\n<p>\n Last but not least, Valve delighted Denzel Curry fans with a new Music Kit that contains hits from the artist’s “Melt My Eyez See Your Future” 2022 album, including “Walkin”, “ULTIMATE”, and more.\n</p>\n<p>\n Music Kit | Denzel Curry, ULTIMATE costs $4.99. It includes an MVP anthem and changes the standard music for:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Main Menu\n </li>\n<li>\n  Round Start and End\n </li>\n<li>\n  Map Objective\n </li>\n<li>\n  Ten-Second Warning\n </li>\n<li>\n  Death Camera\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n You can also get a StatTrack™ variant of the Music Kit | Denzel Curry, ULTIMATE for $7.99 so that it counts each time you become the Most Valuable Player of the round and shows the total number of MVPs you earned with that Music Kit equipped.\n</p>\n<p>\n We expect at least one more weapon case to come out in 2023. However, Valve now releases\n \n  fewer new cases\n \n as opposed to previous years.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  2013-2014: six cases each year\n </li>\n<li>\n  2015-2016: five cases each year\n </li>\n<li>\n  2017-2020: three cases each year\n </li>\n<li>\n  2021-2022: two cases each year\n </li>\n<li>\n  2023: one case (so far)\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Even though the game has been out for over 10 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is still one of the most popular PC games. On February 11, CS:GO reportedly broke a record for the number of concurrent players by reaching 1,329,219, according to\n \n  Steam DB\n \n .\n</p>\n<p>\n We gathered all important\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  CS:GO updates from the previous year\n </a>\n in one article, so give it a read to get a retrospective.
