The Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) tournament series began in 2008. Its 18 season consists of three tournaments: IEM Rio 2023, IEM Dallas 2023, and IEM Cologne 2023.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"IEM_Rio_2023_Format\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  IEM Rio 2023: Format\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Sixteen teams are taking part in the tournament, and they are competing using a fairly simple system. Firstly, two groups were formed in a Double Elimination format, with eight teams each. Then, the three best teams from each group moved on to the Playoff Stage. The tournament prize pool is $250,000, and the winner will receive $100,000 and a ticket to IEM Cologne 2023.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Group_Stage_%D0%90_Overview_Results\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Group Stage –ê: Overview &amp; Results\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Sixteen teams were divided into two groups, with eight in each group. The teams in Group A competed based on their seeding:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Heroic\n </li>\n<li>\n  9INE\n </li>\n<li>\n  BIG\n </li>\n<li>\n  MOUZ\n </li>\n<li>\n  Imperial Esports\n </li>\n<li>\n  Ninjas in Pyjamas\n </li>\n<li>\n  The MongolZ\n </li>\n<li>\n  Natus Vincere\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Let‚Äôs go through each team separately, starting with the Ukrainian team.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Natus_Vincere\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Natus Vincere\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n NAVI‚Äôs first match was against MongolZ.

NAVI won 16:10 on Mirage and 16:13 on Ancient.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"BIG\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  BIG\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n BIG played their first match against MOUZ on Overpass and won with a score of 16:6. Then, they played against Heroic in a Best-of-3 format. Although they lost the first map, they managed to win the next two maps with scores of 16:11 on Nuke and 16:6 on Overpass after pulling themselves together. However, they lost 14:16 on Vertigo.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Heroic\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Heroic\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Heroic won their first match against 9INE on Ancient with a 16:12 score.

They lost to NiP and then faced MongolZ, losing 2-1.\n</p>\n<p>\n The tournament‚Äôs favorites immediately appeared on the first day of the competition. In Group A, these were NAVI and BIG, each with two victories, guaranteeing their place in the Play-off. However, Imperial and MOUZ were less fortunate, losing twice and being eliminated from the tournament.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    THE FIRST TEAM IN THE\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IEM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #IEM\n    </a>\n    RIO 2023 PLAYOFFS!\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natusvincere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @natusvincere\n    </a>\n    have GUARANTEED their spot in front of the Brazilian crowd! üëè\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/npllcs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @npllcs\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/b1tcs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @b1tcs\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/perfectocsgo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @perfectocsgo\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/electronicCSGO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @electronicCSGO\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/s1mpleO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @s1mpleO\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Navi_B1ad3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @Navi_B1ad3\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/pwKix3BghO\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî ESL Counter-Strike (@ESLCS)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/1648086264162185216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    April 17, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    THE SECOND TEAM TO MAKE IT TO THE\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IEM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #IEM\n    </a>\n    RIO 2023 PLAYOFFS! üá©üá™üáßüá∑\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BIGCLANgg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @BIGCLANgg\n    </a>\n    ü•≥\n    <br>\n<br>\n    See you on stage in the Jeunesse arena! üèüÔ∏è\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k1tocs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @k1tocs\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/favenCS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @favenCS\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tabseNcs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @tabseNcs\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hyped_cs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @hyped_cs\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KrimboCS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @KrimboCS\n    </a>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gobelante?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @gobelante\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/fAvpyZ7nh9\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî ESL Counter-Strike (@ESLCS)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESLCS/status/1648143728039657474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    April 18, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Turning our attention to Group B, let‚Äôs discuss what occurred.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Group_Stage_B_Overview_Results\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Group Stage B: Overview &amp; Results\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Just like in Group A, eight teams are competing against each other in Group B.
