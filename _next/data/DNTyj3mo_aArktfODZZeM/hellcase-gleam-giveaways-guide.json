Some tasks may require the use of a balance, while others are completely free.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is worth noting that each <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> has its own tasks and they do not have to be the same. In addition, a participant needs to log in to the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> page via email, Facebook, SoundCloud, Instagram, or Twitter.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n  Now, let’s look at the main tasks for the participants of the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s.\n </em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   “Read it before open cases”\n  </strong>\n  . This is the simplest task, which costs 1 entry. This is an instruction that users should read before performing other tasks.\n </li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   “Open a case”\n  </strong>\n  . This task always includes an offer to open 6 cases from the event category.\n </li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   “Read the letter from <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a>”\n  </strong>\n  . This task involves signing up for the newsletter from <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a>. The participant needs to enter their name and email. This task is available to both subscribed and non-subscribed users.\n </li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n   “Visit our Lovespace”\n  </strong>\n  . The user needs to visit the “Lovespace” page, confirm the action, and get the entries.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Most of the other tasks are effortless. For example, a user just needs to visit a page or share a link on social networks, subscribe to an account on social networks, and invite friends.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"How_Often_do_the_Giveaway_Update\">\n</span>\n How Often do the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> Update?\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> lasts from 7 to 30 days. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> users can how much time is left for the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> by looking at the timer on the event page.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> Gleam <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s&nbsp;that are just about to launch also have a timer.\n</p>\n<p>\n The <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s are limited in time because they are dedicated to specific seasonal events such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day, the\n \n  beginning of spring\n \n , etc.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"How_do_You_Get_Entries_Why_do_You_Need_Them\">\n</span>\n How do You Get Entries &amp; Why do You Need Them?\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Entries are points that the user receives for completing the tasks required to participate in the\n <strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s\n </strong>\n . Each task has its own cost in entries. A player can check their balance on the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> page in the “Entries” field, which is located below the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> logo on the left side of the block.\n</p>\n<p>\n The player can find out the cost of a task in entries before it is completed. The cost is indicated next to the task in the form of a designation (+5, +1, +10).\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Important_Requirements_to_Consider_before_Doing_Tasks_for_Entries\">\n</span>\n Important Requirements to Consider before Doing “Tasks” for Entries!\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Now that you know how\n <strong>\n</strong>\n the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> Gleam <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> works&nbsp;let’s look at an important nuance that you should take into account when completing tasks.\n</p>\n<p>\n To complete a task with a case, the user needs to click on the “Open this case” button and purchase the case on the open page. The user will receive entries after the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-case-opening-sites\" target=\"_blank\">case opening</a> animation plays. If the user simply opens the specified case on the site without using the Gleam link, they will not receive entries.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"How_Does_Winner_Selection_Work\">\n</span>\n How Does Winner Selection Work?\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The number of entries affects the probability of winning. However, there is no leaderboard where the participant with the most entries wins the first prize, the contestant with fewer entries wins the second prize, and the user with even fewer entries wins the third prize.\n</p>\n<p>\n The determination of the winners is carried out randomly, taking into account the user’s activity in obtaining entries. Therefore, with active participation in <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s, the player has a real chance of becoming a winner more than once.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Scammers_Should_Watch_Out_Cheating_Prevention\">\n</span>\n Scammers Should Watch Out: Cheating Prevention\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n We make every attempt to avoid scams such as bots, spam, and false contest accounts. As a result, participants are not permitted to use more than one account to boost their chances of winning the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>. Despite the fact that the user can see the accumulation of entries in fake accounts,\n <strong>\n  only the initial user account will be entered into the draw.\n </strong>\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"When_How_Do_You_Get_Your_GiveawaysPrizes\">\n</span>\n When &amp; How Do You Get Your <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>s/Prizes?\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n We determine the winners within three hours after the end of the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a> and within six hours after the end of the <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-giveaway-sites\" target=\"_blank\">giveaway</a>, all winners will receive an email with congratulations and an information request.\n</p>\n<p>\n Winners need to sign up for <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> to claim their prize. If the prize is a CS:GO, Rust, or Dota 2 skin, then the winner will have access to it through his <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> account.\n</p>\n<p>\n If your prize is a case or a\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  premium subscription\n </a>\n , then you will receive it in the form of a promotional code.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"how to get giveaways &amp; prizes\n\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/DJQpcwf1.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"To_Wrap_Up\">\n</span>\n To Wrap Up!\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<a href=\"#giveaway\">\n  CS:GO skin giveaways&nbsp;from Hellcase\n </a>\n are an attractive opportunity to get a valuable item without any effort or expense.
