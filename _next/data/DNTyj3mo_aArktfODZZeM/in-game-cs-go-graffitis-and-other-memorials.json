These commemorations serve as lasting memories of the defining plays in CS:GO history.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of CS:GO pro players that were honored with their very own graffiti are Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev, Marcelo “coldzera” David, and Olof “olofmeister” Kajbjer Gustafsson.\n</p>\n<p>\n These moments are always selected due to their importance or impact on major tournament outcomes. The community remembers them well for showcasing great strategy and skill or sometimes being controversial. Now, let’s find out the history behind all CS:GO in-game esports memorabilia.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Cache_s1mple%E2%80%99s_Legendary_Double_No-Scope\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Cache: s1mple’s Legendary Double No-Scope\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<em>\n  “What is this clutch from s1mple? What, are you serious? What is that? You can’t do that, s1mple! That’s not allowed! This is not FPL! This is a major!”\n </em>\n</p>\n<p>\n If you have ever wondered about the meaning behind the winged agent graffiti on B Site on Cache and why it appeared on the wall under Heaven, here is the answer.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cache s1mple’s Legendary Double No-Scope\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/Oj11q0my.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n One of the most iconic highlights in the history of competitive CS:GO happened in the midst of the 14th round of the ESL One: Cologne 2016 semifinal clash between Team Liquid and Fnatic, and it inspired the well-known graffiti.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Le9MEt8Vn0?feature=oembed\" title=\"Behind The Graffiti: S1mple\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n\n  Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev\n \n , representing Team Liquid, was left in a 1 versus 2 situation against a duo of his opponents and had to defend Bombsite B alone. It could have been an easy round for the Swedish team, which might have led to a comeback, but s1mple did not let that happen.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sasha peeked mid after fnatic’s dennis killed Hiko and noticed that fnatic players were going to hit the B site. He then quickly rotated to Heaven and jumped off it taking down dennis with an incredible no scope shot and then finishing off KRIMZ with another unbelievable no scope shot.\n</p>\n<p>\n This bold and aggressive play is going down the CS:GO history books as one of the most incredible highlights the world has ever witnessed.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Mirage_Coldzera%E2%80%99s_Midair_AWP_shots\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Mirage: Coldzera’s Midair AWP shots\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n On Mirage, the wall behind Van on B bombsite is adorned with black graffiti of an AWP with two big wings. Instead of the scope, there are four red skulls, referencing the four fallen players. This memorabilia is dedicated to coldzera’s historical play he pulled off back in 2016.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Mirage coldzera's Midair AWP shots\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/QiX0uiUy.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n At MLG Major Columbus 2016, Luminosity Gaming fought Team Liquid for a spot in the Grand Final, and an unbelievable highlight happened in the second half of Mirage. When Team Liquid was one round away from securing the map, they tried to attack B by pushing through Apartments, but their plans were ruined by\n \n  Marcelo “coldzera” David\n \n .\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cjOVXdarUTs?feature=oembed\" title=\"UNBELIEVABLE Jumping AWP Double Noscope by Luminosity Coldzera vs Liquid at MLG CS: GO Major\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Firstly, Marcelo easily killed adreN. Then, he jumped and took down EliGE and s1mple with a single bullet from a no scope in mid-air, and also killed nitr0 with another no scope. After making these four frags, he also tried to get an ace. However, his teammate TACO got the last guy.\n</p>\n<p>\n After this round, Luminosity Gaming performed a comeback and won the map and, eventually, the series. In the Grand Final, they beat Natus Vincere and lifted the MLG Major Columbus 2016 trophy.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Overpass_Olofmeister%E2%80%99s_Fiery_Defuse\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Overpass: Olofmeister’s Fiery Defuse\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Some pros don’t fake, some pros don’t let go no matter what. A beautiful and selfless play by olofmeister granted him immortalization on Overpass. His graffiti with a bewinged Counter-Terrorist agent defusing a bomb in flames is depicted on the wall near Short.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overpass olofmeister’s Fiery Defuse\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/giqm8lGJ.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n In the semifinal match between Fnatic and Dignitas at ESL One: Cologne 2014, Olof “olofmeister” Kajbjer Gustafsson saved the round by going all-in and defusing the planted bomb while burning in the fire of the Molotov thrown by device. He managed to finish defusing milliseconds before dying, and this play went down the history books.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is the video with this highlight from the match.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Z2XeFj4Pmc?feature=oembed\" title=\"CS:GO - olofmeister burning defuse - Team Dignitas vs Fnatic (Cologne 2014 Championship)\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n And here’s the video edit commemorating Olofmeister’s play that fnatic posted on their YouTube Channel.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rd3Uc8Nr0vA?feature=oembed\" title=\"CS:GO Major Moments: Olof On Fire\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n This play secured the match point for fnatic, which they shortly turned into the win in the series. The Swedish team advanced to the Grand Final but did not manage to take the Major trophy home after getting defeated by Ninjas in Pyjamas.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Blacksite_Furlan_GruBy_Signature_Graffiti\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Blacksite: Furlan &amp; GruBy Signature Graffiti\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n A signature graffiti on Blacksite is the only map memorabilia that is dedicated to not an official Major match highlight but a Showmatch highlight.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Blacksite Furlan &amp; GruBy Signature Graffiti\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/4bAO0qUW.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Prior to the IEM Katowice Major 2019 Grand Final, a Bo3 Danger Zone Showmatch was held with eight teams fighting for a right to be immortalized on the map. Furlan and GruBy, who then represented the Polish team AGO Esports, won the series and received their well-deserved graffiti.\n</p>\n<p>\n Furlan secured the win after taking down jks and SPUNJ from the roof of Tourist. At this location, Valve added graffiti with autographs of Furlan and GruBy with a head of a red wolf motif.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Dust_2_fnatic%E2%80%99s_Four_AWPs_Graffiti_Removed\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Dust 2: fnatic’s Four AWPs Graffiti (Removed)\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Although you will not find this graffiti on Dust 2 anymore, as it was permanently removed from the wall near the Terrorist Spawn, the highlight it referenced is truly worth checking out.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"dust 2 fnatic's four AWP graffiti\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/xWuO12yj.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n In the ESL One: Cologne 2015 Grand Final, fnatic played against Team EnVyUs on Dust 2.

For unknown reasons, graffiti of a Terrorist agent holding four sniper rifles was removed from the map two years later in 2017.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Other_Memorabilia_On_CS_GO_Graffiti_Maps_Highlights\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Other Memorabilia On CS:GO Graffiti Maps &amp; Highlights\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Not all highlights from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major events were immortalized in the form of cs:go graffiti on maps they happened on. A number of them were turned into posters and signs, and you can find all of them on Inferno and Overpass. Let’s take a look at all three pieces of memorabilia and find out the history behind them.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Inferno_%E2%80%9CVia_Adamo%E2%80%9D_Street_Sign\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Inferno: “Via Adamo” Street Sign\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Have you heard the story about the mighty “King of Banana”?

Here are all these highlights.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ace with three kills on Banana in the ESL One Cologne 2014 Grand Final against Fnatic.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqrSh-ULwiI?feature=oembed\" title=\"ESL One Cologne 2014: friberg vs. fnatic\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Four frags from Porch in the Copenhagen Games 2014 Grand Final versus Virtus.Pro.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5iWzOLXbPo?feature=oembed\" title=\"Copenhagen Games 2014: friberg vs. Virtus.pro\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Another quadro-kill from Porch, this time in the MLG X Games Aspen Invitational Grand Final against LDLC.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PbYy44k8rgw?feature=oembed\" title=\"MLG X-Games Aspen 2015: friberg vs. LDLC\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Two years later, in 2016, Valve developers updated Inferno and added a street sign on the wall next to Sandbags on Banana reading “Via Adamo”, which means “Adam Street” in Italian.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Overpass_No_Climbing_Sign\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Overpass: No Climbing Sign\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n During DreamHack Winter 2014, a controversial boost method used by Fnatic on Overpass led to cheating allegations and the voluntary withdrawal of the team from the competition.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Overpass No Climbing Sign\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/1mSNtwRF.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Fnatic was playing against Team LDLC in the Quarterfinal of the Major, and after losing the first half of Overpass by 3:12, they decided to try something new. Together with his teammates,\n \n  Olof “olofmeister” Kajbjer Gustafsson\n \n started using a pixel boost that allowed controlling Water and one side of the Pipe near the B site.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DqB95s47f1w?feature=oembed\" title=\"Fnatic olofmeister Overpass boost Vs LDLC full second half with Commentry .\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Abusing this exploit round after round granted the Swedish team the comeback they needed and victory on the map. However, controversy erupted after the match ended, and it led to Fnatic forfeiting the match.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not only Valve modified this spot on Overpass to make it impossible to abuse for boosting, but they also added a metallic sign reading “Geländer übersteigen verboten!” which translates as “Stepping over the railing is forbidden!”\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Inferno_Grenade_Poster\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Inferno: Grenade Poster\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n We all love professional Counter-Strike for 200 IQ plays, and one of the Inferno memorabilia pieces is dedicated to this very kind of highlight.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Inferno Grenade Poster\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/Z6aYHSMK.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n In the PGL Kraków 2017 Grand Final, Gambit played against Immortals on Inferno. In one of the rounds, Dosia threw an HE grenade to the far corner of Pit, where two players of the opposing team were planning to survive the explosion of the planted bomb on the A site. Steel and LUCAS1 both lost more than half of their health points moments before the bomb went off, resulting in two deaths and an economic setback for Immortals.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzeuySdai40?feature=oembed\" title=\"CS:GO - DOSIA 200 IQ HE grenade - Gambit vs Immortals\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Valve commemorated this by adding a faux grenade-perfume ad near the corner, bearing an Italian slogan that translates to “No, you cannot escape now”.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"To_Wrap_Up\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  To Wrap Up!\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The history of competitive Counter-Strike” Global Offensive, which lasted for a decade, has been a breathtaking spectacle, filled with inspiring victories, thrilling matches, and exceptional showcases of individual skill, teamplay, and fortitude.
