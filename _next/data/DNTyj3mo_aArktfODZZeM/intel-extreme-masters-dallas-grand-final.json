The matchups featured four teams: Astralis vs MOUZ and G2 Esports vs FaZe Clan. These teams battled it out for a place in the semifinals, with the understanding that the losing teams would be eliminated from the tournament. Nevertheless, even in defeat, they received $10,000 each and 225 BLAST Premier points.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Astralis_vs_MOUZ\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Astralis vs MOUZ\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n On June 2, the first game of the quarterfinals took place, featuring an exciting match between Astralis and MOUZ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s the list of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  MOUZ removed Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  Astralis removed Mirage\n </li>\n<li>\n  MOUZ picked Inferno\n </li>\n<li>\n  Astralis picked Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  MOUZ removed Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  Astralis removed Anubis\n </li>\n<li>\n  Nuke was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n The teams played on Inferno, picked by MOUZ. It was a highly intense match, with both teams taking turns dominating. In the end, they played 30 rounds and finished the two halves of the map with a 15:15 score, leading them into overtime. Two sets of overtime were needed to determine the winner, and MOUZ secured the victory with a 22:20 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Ancient, the situation was somewhat simpler. In the first half of the map, MOUZ dominated with a 10:5 score and continued their dominance after switching sides. The second map concluded with a 16:9 score in favor of MOUZ.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    .\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mousesports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @mousesports\n    </a>\n    advance to\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IEM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #IEM\n    </a>\n    Dallas 2023 semi-finals over\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AstralisCS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @AstralisCS\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/BjAJ5atLX8\n    \n</p>\n   — HLTV.org (@HLTVorg)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HLTVorg/status/1664743976014938114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    June 2, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Now let’s look at the semifinals.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"G2_Esports_vs_FaZe_Clan\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  G2 Esports vs FaZe Clan\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n The second match in the quarterfinals featured a clash between G2 and FaZe, which took place on June 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n List of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  FaZe removed Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  G2 removed Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  FaZe picked Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  G2 picked Inferno\n </li>\n<li>\n  FaZe removed Nuke\n </li>\n<li>\n  G2 removed Anubis\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mirage was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Despite FaZe picking Inferno, they couldn’t secure a victory. G2 put up a solid performance in the first half playing on the CT side, and continued their dominance after switching sides, ultimately winning the first map.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second map was a disappointment for G2. FaZe established dominance and secured the map with a convincing 16:6 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n The decisive map was Mirage, where experts favored FaZe.

They showcased an impressive performance as terrorists in the first half, finishing it with a 10:5 score. After switching sides, they pushed their opponents and secured an easy victory with a 16:8 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n The next map of the series was Overpass. Heroic had a strong first half with a 10:5 score. Switching sides and playing as counter-terrorists, Heroic maintained their positions and won the map with a final 16:9 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n The decider map posed challenges for both teams, as they played cautiously, avoiding unnecessary risks.
