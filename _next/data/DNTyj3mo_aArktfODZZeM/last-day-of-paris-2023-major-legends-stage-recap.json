These matches determined the last spots for the BLAST.tv Paris Major 2023: Champions Stage. All matches on the final day were played in a best-of-three series.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let’s take a closer look at what unfolded on this intense day!\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Natus_Vincere_vs_FaZe_Clan\">\n</span>\n Natus Vincere vs FaZe Clan\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n The most watched match of the final day was Natus Vincere versus FaZe Clan. It was an incredibly intense match that kept everyone on the edge of their seats until the very last second.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s the list of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  FaZe removed Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  Natus Vincere removed Nuke\n </li>\n<li>\n  FaZe picked Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  Natus Vincere picked Mirage\n </li>\n<li>\n  Natus Vincere removed Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  FaZe removed Inferno\n </li>\n<li>\n  Anubis was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Overpass\">\n</span>\n Overpass\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n At the beginning of the first map, Natus Vincere played on the CT side. They had a rough start, losing with a 4:1 score. However, the team made a full buy in the sixth round, which helped them win that round and several more afterward. Overall, NAVI finished the first half with a decent 9:6 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the second half, playing on the T side, NAVI successfully claimed the first pistol round and the following two force rounds, extending their lead to 12:6. They ultimately secured the map with a 16:13 score.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Another miracle, this time by\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FaZe_rainCS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @FaZe_rainCS\n    </a>\n    in a crazy 1vs3 clutch 🔥\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLASTTVMajor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #BLASTTVMajor\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/QxVuMu0sKk\n    \n</p>\n   — BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1658420892852994048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 16, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Mirage\">\n</span>\n Mirage\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n NAVI had a great start on the second map, winning the first two rounds as terrorists.
