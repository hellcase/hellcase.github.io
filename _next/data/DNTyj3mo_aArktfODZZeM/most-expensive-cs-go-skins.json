Other factors that impact a skin’s price are its rarity and float which varies the skin’s condition from Factory New to Battle-Scarred. For example, skins in Factory New condition are often worth the highest since they drop rarely and are in pristine shape. In addition, skins for knives and gloves tend to cost more than weapon skins.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let’s learn what factors exactly impact the price of skin and\n <strong>\n  how much is the most expensive CS:GO skin\n </strong>\n .\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Rarity\">\n</span>\n Rarity\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Valve came up with 8 levels to determine a skin’s rarity tier. Here is the list of all the grades:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Consumer\n </li>\n<li>\n  Industrial\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mil-Spec\n </li>\n<li>\n  Restricted\n </li>\n<li>\n  Classified\n </li>\n<li>\n  Covert\n </li>\n<li>\n  Contraband\n </li>\n<li>\n  Extraordinary.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Consumer grade is the most prevalent, while Contraband grade is the least prevalent as only one skin has been assigned this exclusive grading —\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  M4A4 | Howl\n </a>\n , CS:GO’s most expensive skin for this weapon. There is a whole dramatic story behind this skin.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Condition\">\n</span>\n Condition\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Skins come in one of the five conditions which define their wear level and are measured by their float value. Here are all available conditions and a corresponding float value range of each:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Battle-Scarred (0.45 to 1.00)\n </li>\n<li>\n  Well-Worn (0.38 to 0.45)\n </li>\n<li>\n  Field-Tested (0.15 to 0.38)\n </li>\n<li>\n  Minimal-Wear (0.07 to 0.15)\n </li>\n<li>\n  Factory New (0.00 to 0.07).\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n As a skin’s float value goes higher, more scratches appear on it, and its pattern fades. Skins with the lowest float value cost the highest as they look much better, and vice-versa. Note that once you acquire a CS:GO skin, its condition can not be changed.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Pattern\">\n</span>\n Pattern\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Each CS:GO skin can have up to 999 pattern variants. The pattern index affects the appearance of the skin by changing the pattern’s placement on the skin or, in some cases, changing colors. Pattern index impacts skins from the Case Hardened skin family the most. Certain patterns of these skins have more blue parts on them than others, making their price go much higher.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"StatTrak%E2%84%A2\">\n</span>\n StatTrak™\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n StatTrak™ keeps track of a player’s performance. It shows the total number of frags a player made using a weapon with a particular StatTrak™ skin equipped. StatTrak™ is available for almost every gun and knife skin, but there are no skins for gloves with it. If you decide to get a StatTrak™ variant of a CS:GO skin, be ready to pay a little more.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Applied_Stickers\">\n</span>\n Applied Stickers\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Some of the CS:GO skins have applied stickers which can both increase and decrease the final price of it. While you can’t decrease the wear level of your skins, you can scratch applied stickers to make them look worn. Also, scratching a sticker is the only way to remove it from your gun. Bear in mind, that once you remove the sticker, it can not be restored and re-applied.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"10_Most_Expensive_Skins\">\n</span>\n 10 Most Expensive Skins\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Over the years, skins have become a vital part of CS:GO. Some players hunt the most expensive cosmetics to gather the highest worth inventory, some want to not only show off their skills but also their skins. Let’s begin our list of the most expensive CS:GO skins.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AK-47_Fire_Serpent_FN\">\n</span>\n AK-47 | Fire Serpent (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Valve added\n <strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AK-47 | Fire Serpent\n  </a>\n</strong>\n to the game with the Operation Bravo Case in 2013. This skin has an image of a green serpent creature from Mayan mythology on its body.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AK-47 Fire Serpent (FN) \" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/97phfabU.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n Today, Factory New\n <strong>\n  AK-47 | Fire Serpent\n </strong>\n with StatTrak™ costs around $7,300.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AK-47_Wild_Lotus_FN\">\n</span>\n AK-47 | Wild Lotus (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n If you think that floral designs do not suit the spirit of CS:GO,\n <strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AK-47 | Wild Lotus\n  </a>\n</strong>\n will certainly prove you wrong.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AK-47 Wild Lotus (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/CAx6FWPl.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n This skin in Factory New condition will cost you at least $9,000. Unfortunately, there are no StatTrak™ variants for\n <strong>\n  AK-47 | Wild Lotus\n </strong>\n .\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"AWP_Gungnir_FN\">\n</span>\n AWP | Gungnir (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Any fans of Norse mythology here? We’ve got a skin for you!\n <strong>\n  AWP | Gungnir\n </strong>\n is an attention-worthy skin for the most popular sniper rifle in CS:GO. Odin’s mighty spear is represented on the skin and adorned with silver wavy lines and curls.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"AWP Gungnir (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/3ZQjE0Lx.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Gungnir\n </strong>\n had a spike in price reaching $14,800 in November, 2022. Today you can get it in Factory New condition for a minimum of $9,500.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"M9_Bayonet_Crimson_Web_FN\">\n</span>\n M9 Bayonet | Crimson Web (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n With its blade painted solid crimson red and a pattern of a thin black spider web applied,\n <strong>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   M9 Bayonet | Crimson Web\n  </a>\n</strong>\n has gained a lot of recognition in the community. To add more fun, the web pattern on each knife is generated randomly, making every variant of this skin unique.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"M9 Bayonet Crimson Web (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/8Ehmftkb.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n The StatTrak™ variant of this skin for M9 Bayonet in Factory New condition sells for around $11,000.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"StatTrak%E2%84%A2_M4A4_Howl_FN\">\n</span>\n StatTrak™ M4A4 | Howl (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n The only Contraband skin,\n <strong>\n  M4A4 | Howl\n </strong>\n is the most controversial skin in CS:GO, and also the rarest. It is a community-made finish that got into the game with the Huntsman Weapon Case in 2014. Shortly after the release, Valve removed the skin from the case due to a copyright infringement and altered its design to bring it back to CS:GO.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"StatTrak™ M4A4 Howl (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/t8Flp807.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n Although you can’t obtain this skin from a case anymore, there are multiple offers on the market. This is the most expensive CS:GO skin for M4A4. Right now, In Factory New condition and with StatTrak™, it costs a minimum of $13,600.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Butterfly_Knife_Gamma_Doppler_Emerald_Phase_FN\">\n</span>\n Butterfly Knife | Gamma Doppler (Emerald Phase, FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Doppler\n </strong>\n and\n <strong>\n  Gamma Doppler\n </strong>\n skin families are unique as they come in several phases that alternate their color palettes. For\n <strong>\n  Gamma Doppler skins\n </strong>\n , there are five phases, including Phases 1 to 4 and the Emerald Phase. The latter is the most expensive one.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Butterfly Knife Gamma Doppler (Emerald Phase, FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/1n4svM15.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n Factory New Butterfly Knife | Gamma Doppler in Emerald Phase is one of the most expensive skins for knives. This is explained by the rarity of the Emerald Phase and the popularity of the Butterfly knife style. It costs around $22,800.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Sport_Gloves_Pandoras_Box_FN\">\n</span>\n Sport Gloves | Pandora’s Box (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Sport Gloves | Pandora’s Box\n </strong>\n skin stands out from the other\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  CS:GO gloves\n </a>\n . These are vivid purple athletic gloves with black and dark blue inserts and a simple but eye-catching pattern.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Sport Gloves Pandora's Box (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/U55sObkC.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n The first skins for gloves appeared in CS:GO in 2016, when Valve released the Brothers in Arms update.

The skin also features four Titan Holo stickers applied, each costing an average of $70,000. This is not only the most expensive CS:GO skin for an AK-47 at the moment but also the oldest. Valve released AK-47 | Case Hardened in 2013 as a part of the first-ever case, CS:GO Weapon Case.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Souvenir_AWP_Dragon_Lore_w_StatTrak%E2%84%A2_FN\">\n</span>\n Souvenir AWP | Dragon Lore w/ StatTrak™ (FN)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Dragon Lore\n </strong>\n has become a legendary skin since its release in 2014 as a part of the Cobblestone souvenir package. In 2018, developers removed Cobblestone from the Active Duty Map Pool. The map became unavailable in the game and was no longer played in any official matches, meaning you could not receive Cobblestone souvenir packages anymore.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Souvenir AWP Dragon Lore w StatTrak™ (FN)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/ItfGoBE4.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n Today, you can get Factory New\n <strong>\n  StatTrak™ Souvenir AWP | Dragon Lore\n </strong>\n by purchasing it directly for $430,000+ or test your luck and open one of the Souvenir Cobblestone Packages, which are extra rare as well. Who knows, maybe once Valve brings back Cobblestone, we will witness a drop in this skin’s price.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Karambit_Case_Hardened_Blue_Gem\">\n</span>\n Karambit | Case Hardened (Blue Gem)\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Even the common patterns of the\n <strong>\n  Karambit | Case Hardened\n </strong>\n are already pricey enough. You would have to shell out from $1,000 to $4,000 for a common pattern in Factory New condition. However, we’re not here for ordinary skins, are we?\n</p>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Karambit Case Hardened (Blue Gem)\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/AduWFBVb.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n<p>\n Pattern 387 of the Karambit | Case Hardened in Factory New condition is considered to be the most expensive CS:GO skin for a knife, as of today. It differs from the other variants due to its blade being solid and vibrant blue.\n</p>\n<p>\n The owner bought it for $100,000 in 2016 and the price of the Blue Gem has massively grown since then.\n \n  He turned down an offer for $1.4 Million\n \n saying it was too low. Even though the deal did not happen, someone was willing to spend a fortune on a knife skin.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"To_Conclude\">\n</span>\n To Conclude!\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n This concludes our list of CS:GO’s most expensive skins.
