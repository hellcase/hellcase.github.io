Data mining is a way to find clues on upcoming game updates and provide insights about the game‚Äôs mechanics.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have scoured the web to bring you the latest finding of data miners who have been examining the Counter-Strike 2 game files since the start of the Limited Test. Here, we will find out about new knife styles, possible Danger Zone updates, and much more.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"New_Knives\">\n</span>\n New Knives\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Data miners found information about two knives that might be added to Counter-Strike 2. One is called Twinblade, and the other is called Kukri.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Twinblade_Knife\">\n</span>\n Twinblade Knife\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n In our opinion, Twinblade is an eye-catching knife worth paying attention to. it is possible that it will become one of the most popular knives once released.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Another \"Twinblade\" knife found in\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CounterStrike?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @CounterStrike\n    </a>\n    beta files üò≥\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/qf3Kw9gLQo\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî ‚ÄéGabe Follower (@gabefollower)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1638834899363803136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 23, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Kukri_Knife\">\n</span>\n Kukri Knife\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Kukri knife has a blade in an interesting shape.

Imagine always having your favorite game in your pocket wherever you go!\n</p>\n<p>\n Since a lot of PC games like Fortnite, PUBG, and CoD have been released as mobile versions, maybe it‚Äôs finally time for CS2 to get one. The only question is, who reaches this point first, Valve or Riot?\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"New_Announcer_Voices\">\n</span>\n New Announcer Voices\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Yes, the new radio announcements are coming to Counter-Strike 2 in male and female voices.

The only sprays you can use in-game are Valve-made, and you can receive them as in-game drops and buy them on Steam Market or third-party websites.\n</p>\n<p>\n Also, unlike CS 1.6 and CS:S sprays, the CS:GO sprays are consumable. You can only use a spray 50 times before you need to get a new one.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although you will most likely not be able to use custom graffiti sprays in Counter-Strike 2, it is still great that community-made sprays may be presented in the Steam Workshop and eventually added to the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n Do you have any ideas for a new custom graffiti spray already?
