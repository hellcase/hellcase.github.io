Still, they achieved significant success on July 10, 2016, when they secured 2nd place at the ESL One: Cologne 2016, earning a prize of $150,000. From there, Team Liquid participated in many tournaments but mostly secured 4th or 5th place during 2016-2017.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their true success story began with the ESL Pro League Season 7, where they showcased impressive gameplay and continued to perform well in subsequent tournaments:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n\n   The Esports Championship Series Season 5\n  \n  ‚Äì 2nd place ($120,000)\n </li>\n<li>\n\n   The ELEAGUE CS:GO Premier 2018\n  \n  ‚Äì 2nd place ($200,000)\n </li>\n<li>\n\n   The ESL Pro League Season 8\n  \n  ‚Äì 2nd place ($100,000)\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n With each tournament, the team grew stronger, improved their gameplay, and gained more confidence. The turning point for Team Liquid came with their 1st place finish at the&nbsp;Intel Extreme Masters XIV. Following this victory, the team was powerful. They went on to win the&nbsp;DreamHack Masters Dallas 2019, the&nbsp;ESL Pro League Season 9, and needed one more victory to claim the prestigious&nbsp;Intel Grand Slam&nbsp;award and $1,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n They managed to do it. Their triumph came at&nbsp;ESL One: Cologne 2019, earning $125,000 and capturing the most coveted prize in CS:GO, the Intel Grand Slam. Although Team Liquid continued to perform well, this period was their most memorable and successful.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Reasons_for_Concluding_the_Career_and_Saying_Goodbye_to_Team_Liquid\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Reasons for Concluding the Career and Saying Goodbye to Team Liquid\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The legendary player of Team Liquid has expressed his intention to leave professional CS:GO.
