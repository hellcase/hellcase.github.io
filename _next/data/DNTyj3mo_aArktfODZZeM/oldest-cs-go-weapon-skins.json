Some of them are made by Valve, and some are getting picked from the Steam Workshop. Skins come in various patterns, floats, and rarity types that impact their price. In terms of rarity, for example, there are seven types of skins: Consumer, Industrial, Mil-spec, Restricted, Classified, Covert, and Contraband.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cosmetics haven’t been around since the beginning, though. Let’s dive into history and learn about the oldest CS:GO skins.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"what are cs:go skin\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/wox75J06.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Weapon_Skins_History\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Weapon Skins History\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n The history of CS:GO weapon skins starts in 2013, a year after Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was officially released.\n \n  The Arms Deal update\n \n blessed the players with the first CS:GO skins that you could get by opening weapon skin cases with case-specific keys. With the new update, players got a chance to receive a free case after finishing a match on a VAC-secured server. This mechanic still works for everyone. Free cosmetics are getting dropped upon completing matches in official game modes.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the Arms Deal update, Valve also announced that players will be able to upload their own weapon finishes and custom knife models through the CS:GO Workshop. Most up-voted skins would get a chance to appear in future CS:GO updates. In 2014, developers released the first weapon case with community-made finishes, the Winter Offensive Weapon Case. It featured 12 weapon skins created by the community, including M4A4 | Asiimov.\n</p>\n<p>\n Along with the first gun skins from the\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  CS:GO Weapon Case\n </a>\n , Valve brought the melee skins into the game: Karambit, Bayonet, Gut Knife, M9 Bayonet, and Flip Knife. Every style of the knife skin comes in one of the thirteen finishes: Vanilla, Blue Steel, Boreal Forest, Case Hardened, Crimson Web, Fade, Forest DDPAT, Night, Safari Mesh, Scorched, Slaughter, Stained, and Urban Masked.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"weapon skin history\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/jvcEtSu2.jpeg\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Apart from that, StatTrak™ modules also came along, giving you an up-to-date record of every kill you get with that weapon. StatTrak™ also first appeared in the&nbsp;CS:GO Weapon Case, meaning that even the oldest CS:GO skin can have this feature. It is a great way to show off but bear in mind that teamkills do not count (anyway, team damage is bad, don’t be that guy!).\n</p>\n<p>\n Before 2017, there was no information available about the real odds of obtaining different tier items by opening CS:GO weapon skin cases. However, due to the\n \n  Chinese Ministry of Culture’s Online Gaming\n \n Operating Regulations and supervising requests,&nbsp;Valve was obliged to reveal the odds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is the ratio data Valve displayed publicly in 2017:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Mil-spec to Restricted is 1:5.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mil-spec to Classified is 1:25.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mil-spec to Covert is 1:125.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mil-spec to Rare Special Item is 2:625.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Normal to StatTrak™ is 1:10.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n With this ratio data, we can calculate the odds of getting all the rarity tier items in percentage:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Mil-spec – 79.92%.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Restricted – 15.98%.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Classified – 3.2%.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Covert – 0.64%.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Rare Special Item – 0.26%.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Now you know a bit of CS:GO skins history and what are your chances of getting a knife skin from a case. Let’s get back to the topic though. To find out what is the oldest CS:GO skin, we will figure out which cases came first.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"The_First_CS_GO_Cases\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  The First CS:GO Cases\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n There are three types of CS:GO weapon skin cases: Black, Yellow, and eSports. Both black and eSports contain skins made by Valve, but a portion of the latter’s key profit supports the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive eSports scene. Yellow cases consist of community-made finishes picked from the Steam Workshop. A portion of the yellow cases’ profit goes to the creators of the skins that made it into the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first-ever weapon skin case was released nine years ago. Among the pioneers are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  CS:GO Weapon Case\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   eSports 2013 Case\n  </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Operation Bravo Case\n  </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Winter Offensive Weapon Case\n  </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Huntsman Weapon Case\n  </a>\n  , and others.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Now we will take a look inside the CS:GO Weapon Case and overview its cosmetics.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"CS_GO_Weapon_Case\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  CS:GO Weapon Case\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Valve introduced the CS:GO Weapon Case, also known as Container series 1, in August, 2013.

Lightning Strike is the oldest CS:GO skin for AWP and it is perfect for striking the enemy team unexpectedly. The body of this weapon is painted purple metallic and presents a realistic lightning bolt rushing through the sniper rifle. This skin is can be obtained only in Factory New and Minimal Wear variants due to its low float value range.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although these are the oldest CS:GO weapon skins, players appreciate them to this day.
