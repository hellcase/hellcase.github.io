This is a great solution for CS:GO players who are bored with the usual <a href=\"https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-case-opening-sites\" target=\"_blank\">case opening</a> with a chance to get only one skin. To open one of the On Fire cases, the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> user needs to find the corresponding tab on the site and select the case they like.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3WK5iFoSHo?feature=oembed\" title=\"Opening the On Fire case\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n After clicking on the “Open” case button, the system shows a progressive bar with the time required to open the case. The user can see his case and the animation of its opening in the block for selecting the number of cases. After opening the case, the user can evaluate his prizes and open one of the On Fire cases again.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"What_Else_to_Consider\">\n</span>\n What Else to Consider?\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n What happens if the user opens two or three cases at once? There is a possibility to open On Fire cases by <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> one by one. The user can track the opening of a case using a progressive bar. After showing the prizes won in the block for choosing the number of openings, we move all prizes below this block. After that, the user can open the second and third cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n We move all the prizes from the second case to the prizes from the first case and the prizes from the third case to the prizes from the first and second cases. You won’t get confused as the system displays identical prizes separately. This is useful, for example, if the user received\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  wartags\n </a>\n or a balance in the first and second cases. In the end, the user can take part in a new event or simply enjoy the gifts received.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"To_Wrap_up\">\n</span>\n To Wrap up!\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n On Fire Cases is an interesting and advantageous feature from\n <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3DJLlm8\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Hellcase\n </a>\n .
