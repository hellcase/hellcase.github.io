The first team to create a remarkable impression and reach the Grand Final was GamerLegion. For them, it was their first major offline event with such a substantial prize pool.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second team to secure a spot in the Grand Final was Vitality, who enjoyed enthusiastic support from their fans on their home turf. The victory was of utmost significance for Mathieu ‚ÄúZywOo‚Äù Herbaut, as he had come a long way and had been close to championships several times but had not yet succeeded. He was eager to win on this stage to prove to himself and the world that he deserved this victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before the main series of games started, the customary show match took place, which was particularly captivating and entertaining compared to previous years. This year‚Äôs show match featured players using unlimited weapons, zero gravity, monitors turned off, relying solely on sound cues, and real smoke grenades being launched directly at the players in the game zone, creating many exciting and amusing moments that we highly recommend watching.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Highlights of the blind fire round\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/95PyutKQAu\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660275820542189571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"zxx\">\n\n     pic.twitter.com/HdDK6lPwrv\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660275511266869248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    This is the work of the\n    \n     https://t.co/vjuelXyzdS\n    \n    chat\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/cN5e3AdkDL\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660270949411766274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    üé∫ HE IS BACK üé∫\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/5TCOJXHivK\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660283161589186561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Now, let‚Äôs dive into the match between Vitality and GamerLegion.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Vitality_vs_GamerLegion\">\n</span>\n Vitality vs GamerLegion\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n Here‚Äôs how the teams‚Äô presentation took place before the start of the Grand Final of the BLAST.tv Paris Major 2023.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    First team in the arena:\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GamerLegion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @GamerLegion\n    </a>\n    üî•\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/IY0HEvXiW7\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660298426033086467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    What a welcome,\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamVitality?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @TeamVitality\n    </a>\n    üêù\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/8MiQsGKeC1\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660300150382755843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n The final match of the last CS:GO Major kicked off with the usual process of map selection and bans, played as a classic Bo3.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here‚Äôs the list of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion removed Anubis\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality removed Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion picked Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality picked Nuke\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality removed Mirage\n </li>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion removed Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  Inferno was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Overpass\">\n</span>\n Overpass\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n GamerLegion picked Overpass. Judging from both teams‚Äô performance on this map, it was evident that they had similar results, with both teams boasting a win rate of around 70% and showing confidence in their gameplay. As a result, the map promised an intense showdown.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the first half, GamerLegion, playing as terrorists, won the first round and tried to win the second force round. However, Vitality took a gamble by heavily relying on ZywOo. He purchased a Scout after losing the first round.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this decision paid off, as ZywOo secured two important kills, enabling the team to win two rounds with just one device. Following this success, Vitality gained the necessary funds for proper devices, and they also picked up the opponents‚Äô weapons, granting them a significant economic advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n Capitalizing on this advantage, Vitality claimed victory in six consecutive rounds. With a solid economic foundation and defending their side, Vitality concluded the first half with an 11:4 score.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Not even close,\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vitality_apEX?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @Vitality_apEX\n    </a>\n    üëÄ\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/XvGbmWdzNW\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660308602345734144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n After switching sides, Vitality successfully planted the bomb, but they and the bomb got eliminated before it could explode. However, planting the bomb gave the team additional funds to buy weapons. With the weapons they acquired, Vitality won the second and secured round after round, ultimately finishing the first map with a 16:6 score.\n</p>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Nuke\">\n</span>\n Nuke\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n The second map of the series was Nuke, picked by Vitality. Interestingly, both teams had played an equal number of matches on this map (9 matches each). However, while Vitality had not lost on this map in their previous matches, their opponent had suffered defeats in four out of nine matches.\n</p>\n<p>\n GamerLegion played on the CT side and won the first round. Vitality decided not to take any risks as they did in the previous map and played out the second round with pistols, resulting in an easy 2:0 for GamerLegion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Vitality bought weapons and won the third round, but they couldn‚Äôt start to dominate. GamerLegion confidently held their positions and displayed an impressive performance on the CT side in the first half, ending it with a strong 10:5 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second half of the map was emotionally intense for Vitality because a loss would mean going to a third map where their chances were lower than their signature map, Nuke. Gathering themselves, Vitality adjusted their game, taking their time and holding deep defensive positions, which gave them a significant advantage over GamerLegion, who had to face a crossfire.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    ZYWOOOOOOO IS HERE üêê\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/mIO6WUDoVN\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî Team Vitality üêù (@TeamVitality)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamVitality/status/1660329921141526534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 21, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n It helped Vitality stage an extraordinary comeback, equalizing the score and surpassing their opponent.
