NAVI had opportunities to make a comeback, they even won three rounds in a row during the second half. However, thanks to Viktor ‚Äúsdy‚Äù Orudzhev and his team, Monte emerged victorious on the first map with a 16:12 score.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"cs\">\n    –°heck his PC\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/demqqqq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @demqqqq\n    </a>\n    ü´£\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/iQyIEStiJJ\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî MONTE ESPORTS üá∫üá¶ (@Monte_Esports)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Monte_Esports/status/1658094274607554562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 15, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Nuke\">\n</span>\n Nuke\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n Before the second map, most analysts predicted that Monte wouldn‚Äôt be able to defeat NAVI with a 2:0 score because Nuke is NAVI‚Äôs signature map. However, what unfolded on the second map was truly impressive. Playing on the CT side, Monte completely dominated their opponents. They won an incredible ten rounds in a row and finished the first half with a commanding lead of 13:2.\n</p>\n<p>\n Despite the NAVI team‚Äôs efforts, including using all their timeouts and attempting different strategies, they couldn‚Äôt turn the tide.
