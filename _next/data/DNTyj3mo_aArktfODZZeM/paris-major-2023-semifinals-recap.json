Four strong teams battled for the spot in the Grand Final, but only two moved on and had a chance to lift the trophy at the last CS:GO Major. All matches in the semifinals were played in a best-of-three series.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let’s review these matches and see how it all went.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Heroic_vs_GamerLegion\">\n</span>\n Heroic vs GamerLegion\n <span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n The first match was between Heroic and GamerLegion. Now, let’s dive into the details of this match.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s the list of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion removed Anubis\n </li>\n<li>\n  Heroic removed Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion picked Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  Heroic picked Inferno\n </li>\n<li>\n  Heroic removed Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  GamerLegion removed Nuke\n </li>\n<li>\n  Mirage was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Ancient\">\n</span>\n Ancient\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n GamerLegion picked Ancient. They started on the T side and successfully planted the bomb in the first three rounds. However, Heroic managed to eliminate their entire team and defuse the bomb without much difficulty in these rounds. GamerLegion had a good eco round to maintain their economy.\n</p>\n<p>\n They then went on to win six consecutive rounds, turning the score from 3:0 to 3:6 in their favor. Although Heroic had opportunities to win more rounds, GamerLegion’s teamwork prevented them from doing so. The first half ended with GamerLegion leading 10:5.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    LINE EM UP,\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iMeCSGO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @iMeCSGO\n    </a>\n    🔥\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BLASTTVMajor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     #BLASTTVMajor\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/IciXkmidfQ\n    \n</p>\n   — BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1659910801413505027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 20, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n The second half of the first map started well for Heroic as they won the pistol round playing as terrorists. It was a crucial victory for Heroic, and they continued their success by winning seven rounds in a row. It equalized the score and gave them a two-round advantage over GamerLegion, with a 12:10 score. GamerLegion tried to turn the game around, but Heroic pushed them and ultimately finished the first map with a 16:13 score.\n</p>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Inferno\">\n</span>\n Inferno\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n Although Heroic picked Inferno for their match against GamerLegion, the latter team had much experience playing on this map against strong opponents. It set the stage for a tense and highly competitive match. Initially, Heroic had a smooth start, securing the first four rounds on the T side.\n</p>\n<p>\n However, in the fifth round, GamerLegion won their first round and stabilized their economy. What followed was an incredible comeback by GamerLegion, winning eight consecutive rounds and ending the first half with a 9:6 lead in their favor.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    It's Ace of the Day time and for today's Semi-Final action sjuush takes the award for this Ace! ♠\n    <br>\n<br>\n    Presented by\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlpineEsports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @AlpineEsports\n    </a>\n\n     pic.twitter.com/BOTiLENobW\n    \n</p>\n   — BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1660019834665435136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 20, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n After switching sides, Heroic defended and patiently waited for GamerLegion to make mistakes.

Most fans wore branded yellow and black Vitality shirts, creating a visually striking scene. The stands resounded with chants and slogans dedicated to their team, demonstrating the immense support for Vitality. However, with this overwhelming support comes a great sense of responsibility for the team.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here’s the list of map selections and bans:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Apeks removed Nuke\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality removed Ancient\n </li>\n<li>\n  Apeks picked Mirage\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality picked Vertigo\n </li>\n<li>\n  Vitality removed Anubis\n </li>\n<li>\n  Apeks removed Overpass\n </li>\n<li>\n  Inferno was left over\n </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>\n<span id=\"Mirage-2\">\n</span>\n Mirage\n <span>\n</span>\n</h4>\n<p>\n Apeks picked Mirage for the match because Vitality banned Ancient, which Apeks performs well on. Now, let’s focus on the game itself. In the first half, Vitality played on the CT side and started strongly by winning the first four rounds. They felt confident on this map, but Apeks rallied and showed their capabilities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Both teams played evenly, with the score tied at 7:7 after fourteen rounds. However, in the fifteenth round, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire’s triple kill gave Vitality a slight edge, ending the first half on the first map with a narrow lead of 8:7.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    THOSE GLOCK KILLS,\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/STYKOcsgo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n     @STYKOcsgo\n    </a>\n    🤯🤯🤯\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/SjO9r324Hf\n    \n</p>\n   — BLAST.tv (@BLASTtv)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLASTtv/status/1659985413161865217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    May 20, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n After switching sides, Vitality started strong with an excellent pistol round and won the next two.
