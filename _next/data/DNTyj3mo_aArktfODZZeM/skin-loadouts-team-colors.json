Combining skins is a great way for players to express their individuality within the game.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"CS_GO_Teams_Loadouts_Ranked_10th_-_5th\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  CS:GO Teams Loadouts (Ranked 10th – 5th)\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n To assemble the best CS:GO team loadouts for their fans to use, we chose top-10 teams from the latest\n \n  HLTV Team Ranking of December, 2022\n \n . The HLTV team ranking is among the most accurate and respected ones in the CS:GO community.\n</p>\n<p>\n This system ranks the world’s best CS:GO teams based on their performance in major tournaments and their overall level of shape. In this part of the article, you will find loadouts inspired by teams that were placed 10th – 5th.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here are the five teams we will be covering in the first part of the article:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  FURIA.\n </li>\n<li>\n  MOUZ.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Cloud9.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Natus Vincere.\n </li>\n<li>\n  fnatic.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n For Each loadout, we assembled six skins for gloves, a knife, and guns. Let’s begin!\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"FURIA_Loadout\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  FURIA Loadout\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n During the off-season period in January, saffee joined FURIA. The Brazilian team won the PGL Major Antwerp Americas RMR, but finished 5-8th at the PGL Major Antwerp. Their best moments also include second place at the ESL Challenger February, 7-8th at the IEM Cologne, and 3-4th at the IEM Rio Major.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"FURIA Loadout\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/unxSRHUE.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n We assembled the FURIA Loadout with CS:GO skins in an elegant combination of white and black to match the team colors. Here are all of them:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Moto Gloves | Smoke Out\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  Karambit | Stained.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AWP | Graphite\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  M4A4 | Magnesium.\n </li>\n<li>\n  MAC-10 | Silver.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Desert Eagle | Printstream\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n For FURIA fans, we have prepared a few simple but stylish options.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Moto Gloves | Smoke Out\n </strong>\n will make a great combo not only with a patina-styled\n <strong>\n  Karambit | Stained\n </strong>\n , but with any other skin here. There is also the Classified\n <strong>\n  AWP | Graphite\n </strong>\n in Anodized Multicolored finish style and a polygon pattern, and\n <strong>\n  M4A4 | Magnesium\n </strong>\n with a pattern that resembles flames.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  MAC-10 | Silver\n </strong>\n , coated in transparent silver paint, will not cost you a dime, and it’s so satisfying to play with. For the pistol choice, we went with an eye-catchy\n <strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Printstream\n </strong>\n .\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"MOUZ_Loadout\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  MOUZ Loadout\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n In 2022, MOUZ received some fresh blood: three young players from MOUZ NXT, the organization’s junior CS:GO academy. Between January and August, torzsi, JDC, and xertioN joined the main MOUZ roster.\n</p>\n<p>\n The team placed 9-12th both at the IEM Katowice and IEM Dallas, on 13-16th in the ESL Pro League Season 15. Their most significant highlight of the year was 3-4th place at the IEM Rio Major.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"MOUZ Loadout\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/QIpf6zZK.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n The MOUZ Loadout consists of CS:GO skins with a predominantly red and white color palette. Here’s the list:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Sport Gloves | Slingshot\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  Talon Knife | Doppler.\n </li>\n<li>\n  SCAR-20 | Bloodsport.\n </li>\n<li>\n  AK-47 | Red Laminate.\n </li>\n<li>\n  PP-Bizon | High Roller.\n </li>\n<li>\n  USP-S | Cyrex.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n We wish there were vibrant red and white gloves to match the elegant looks of\n <strong>\n  Talon Knife | Doppler\n </strong>\n (Phase Ruby), but right now, we had to go with\n <strong>\n  Sport Gloves | Sling Shot\n </strong>\n . For a sniper rifle, we picked hued\n <strong>\n  SCAR-20 | Bloodsport\n </strong>\n with a number of inscriptions and various icons.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AK-47 | Red Laminate\n </strong>\n has its wooden parts partially painted red, it’s a Classified skin with a Hydrographic finish style. PP-Bizon might not be as popular as other SMGs presented in the game, but a fine skin like\n <strong>\n  PP-Bizon | High Roller\n </strong>\n can be a game changer.\n</p>\n<p>\n The futuristic USP | Cyrex made in white, black and red, is adorned with several inscriptions, a small icon of a counter-terrorist, and geometric shapes.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Cloud9_Loadout\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Cloud9 Loadout\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Cloud9 bought the whole Gambit roster in the first half of 2022. They performed poorly at the PGL Major Antwerp and finished the first major tournament of the year in 12-14th place. Cloud9 placed 9-12th at the IEM Cologne and 5-8th at the IEM Rio Major. The only championship title they claimed throughout the year was at the IEM Dallas.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Cloud 9 Loadout\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/EyTlfQ08.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n In the Cloud9 Loadout, you can find skins in colors presented on the team’s logo – blue and white. These are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Moto Gloves | Cool Mint.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Gut Knife | Bright Water.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AWP | Neo-Noir\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  AK-47 | Vulcan.\n </li>\n<li>\n  P-90 | Traction.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Desert Eagle | Cobalt Disruption.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Made of dark blue-ish leather,\n <strong>\n  Moto Gloves | Cool Mint\n </strong>\n have shell protectors and are decorated with a geometric design.\n <strong>\n  Gut Knife | Bright Water\n </strong>\n is painted with a blue camouflage hydrographic, it’s the perfect knife skin to match the gloves.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Neo-Noir\n </strong>\n comes from a well-known skin family, and it depicts two women painted in shades of blue and magenta. Then, we got\n <strong>\n  AK-47 | Vulcan\n </strong>\n , a community-made skin custom-painted in a sports-inspired design using a color palette of blue, white, black, and gray.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  Desert Eagle | Cobalt Disruption\n </strong>\n speaks for itself – it’s covered in metallic foil adorned with a pixelated digital pattern.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Natus_Vincere_Loadout\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Natus Vincere Loadout\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Natus Vincere have dominated the CS:GO scene in 2021, and fans expected them to continue building the NAVI era in 2022. However, one of the most challenging years in Natus Vincere players’ professional careers hit them.\n</p>\n<p>\n They placed 3-4th at the IEM Katowice, lost the PGL Major Antwerp Grand Final, then went through roster changes. In May, NAVI benched BoomI4, signed somedieyoung as a stand-in player, and made electronic the new IGL.\n</p>\n<p>\n With somedieyoung, NAVI won BLAST Premier Spring Final and IEM Road to Rio Europe RMR B, placed 2nd at the IEM Cologne, 5-8th at IEM Rio Major, and 5-6th at both Fall and World Finals of BLAST Premier. In December,\n \n  sdy was replaced with npl\n \n , a player from NAVI Junior.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"Natus Vincere Loadout\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/pNf35MQ3.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Here is the list of skins for the Natus Vincere Loadout, all in black and yellow:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Sport Gloves | Omega\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  Karambit | Tiger Tooth.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AWP | Phobos\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  M4A4 | Buzz Kill.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   MP9 | Bulldozer\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Five-SeveN | Monkey Business\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n It was quite a challenge, but we found one pair of black and yellow gloves –\n <strong>\n  Sport Gloves | Omega\n </strong>\n , and they are a decent match to\n <strong>\n  Karambit | Tiger Tooth\n </strong>\n . Some of this knife skin’s variants might have a more yellow-ish blade.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n  AWP | Phobos\n </strong>\n , inspired by the “Blade Runner” movie, looks like a blaster straight out of the future. It has green metal plates on its body and is adorned with a lot of details: yellow stripes, screens, indicators, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another futuristic skin in NAVI Loadout,\n <strong>\n  M4A4 | Buzz Kill\n </strong>\n is painted in black, yellow, and shades of olive and has well-thought white accents.\n <strong>\n  Five-SeveN | Monkey Business\n </strong>\n depicts a yellow banana with a blue sticker on it. Unfortunately, the StatTrak™ variants of this skin are not programmed to count all the bananas you eat.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"fnatic_Loadout\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  fnatic Loadout\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n fnatic’s year began with a 9-12th place at the IEM Katowice. They managed to qualify for PGL Major Antwerp Europe RMR, but didn’t make it to the main event. During summer, three new players joined KRIMZ and mezil in fnatic: nicoodoz, roeJ, and FASHR.\n</p>\n<p>\n The new roster became the REPUBLEAGUE Season 3 runner-ups, finished 9-12th in ESL Pro League Season 16, and 5-8th at the IEM Rio Major. fnatic also won Elisa Masters Espoo 2022.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"fnatic Loadout\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://s.4tr.cc/askPn2hy.jpeg\" width=\"868\">\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Skins in the fnatic Loadout all feature black color and shades of orange. Here’s the list:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   Specialist Gloves | Foundation\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  M9 Bayonet | Tiger Tooth.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   AWP | BOOM\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n<li>\n  M4A1-S | Atomic Alloy.\n </li>\n<li>\n  MP7 | Abyssal Apparition.\n </li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">\n   USP-S | Orion\n  </a>\n  .\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n The color scheme of\n <strong>\n  Specialist Gloves | Foundation\n </strong>\n hits the spot just right: the orange accents suit the gray base and white inserts perfectly.\n <strong>\n  M9 Bayonet | Tiger Tooth\n </strong>\n looks fantastic combined with the gloves. “BOOM!”, “POW!”, “CRACK!”, “BLAM!”. No, no one is having a stroke.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are just inscriptions you can spot in speech bubbles on orange-painted\n <strong>\n  AWP | BOOM\n </strong>\n . Anodized in black and orange,\n <strong>\n  M4A1-S | Atomic Alloy\n </strong>\n has a hexagon pattern on its body, and will be a great addition to your inventory. Last but not least,\n <strong>\n  USP-S | Orion\n </strong>\n is painted black and orange and is complemented with animalistic stripes and dotted patterns.\n</p>\n<h3>\n<span id=\"Conclusion\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Conclusion\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h3>\n<p>\n We hope you enjoyed our loadouts dedicated to the best CS:GO teams at the moment.
