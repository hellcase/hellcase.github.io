Weapon skins have a digital LED counter attached to them, and it keeps track of frags a player makes with this skin, while StatTrak™ Music Kits keep count of player’s round MVP awards.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the StatTrak™ technology is a great feature for players who enjoy tracking their progress or showing off their kill counts, it’s crucial to note that it does not provide any gameplay advantages. It is a purely cosmetic addition allowing players to customize the appearance of their in-game weapons and does not affect the weapon’s damage, accuracy, or any other performance attributes.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"How_to_Get_StatTrak%E2%84%A2_Skins_in_CS_GO\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  How to Get StatTrak™ Skins in CS:GO?\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n There is a variety of ways how to obtain CS:GO StatTrak™ skins. Let’s break down this topic and learn more about each.\n</p>\n<p>\n The most obvious way to get yourself a CS:GO StatTrak™ skin is by buying it off the\n <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/market\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Steam Community Market\n </a>\n . When a StatTrak™ item, whether it is a weapon skin or a music kit, is sold on the Steam Market, the counter will reset to zero.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another way to add a new StatTrak™ item to your arsenal is by unboxing it from a case in-game. According to the public data disclosed by Valve in 2017, the odds of unboxing a StatTrak™ variant of a weapon skin from a CS:GO case is 1:10.\n</p>\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img alt=\"ak-47 aquamarine revenge, awp asiimov, M4A4 龍王 (Dragon King)\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px\" src=\"https://4stake.win/skVlCF5l.jpeg\" width=\"868\"/>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<p>\n Last but not least, you can explore third-party case-opening websites like <a href=\"https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX\" target=\"_blank\">Hellcase</a> for great deals and affordable weapon skins with the StatTrak™ feature.

Here are some key facts about StatTrak™ that every CS:GO enthusiast should know:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n  StatTrak™ weapons exclusively record frags made by their original owners. When a StatTrak™ weapon is not in possession of its original owner, the LED display will cyclically alternate between displaying “ERROR” and “UNKNOWN USER”.\n </li>\n<li>\n  StatTrak™ does not count team kills and bot kills, regardless of the bot’s skill level.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Using StatTrak™ Swap Tool, you can move a LED counter from one StatTrak™ weapon skin to another StatTrak™ weapon skin of your choice, but these finishes have to be of the same. For example, AK-47 to AK-47 or P90 to P90. The tool can be purchased from the in-game store for $0.99.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Players can trade up their StatTrak™ weapons to potentially obtain higher-tier StatTrak™ skins, but they cannot mix StatTrak™ and non-StatTrak™ skins in the trade-up contract.\n </li>\n<li>\n  StatTrak™ variants are unavailable for the standard or “vanilla” weapon models in CS:GO. However, there are StatTrak™ variants of vanilla knives, excluding the Classic style.\n </li>\n<li>\n  If you wish to do so, you can manually reset the StatTrak™ counter on your weapon to zero. This might be done for various reasons, such as wanting to start fresh with a new kill count.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Do not confuse CS:GO StatTrak™ with CS:GO stat tracker, as the latter is a type of third-party platform and application that monitors your in-game statistics.\n </li>\n<li>\n  Although StatTrak™ has a “™” in its name, Valve did not register it as a trademark.\n </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n Still debating whether StatTrak™ skin is the right choice for you and deciding whether to pick up a regular CS:GO skin or its StatTrak™ variant? Let’s figure it out together now.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Are_CS_GO_StatTrak%E2%84%A2_Skins_Worth_It\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  Are CS:GO StatTrak™ Skins Worth It?\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n One of the reasons to go for a StatTrak™ skin over a regular one is that it allows you to showcase your proficiency with a specific weapon by tracking your kill count. If displaying your achievements in this way is important to you, then StatTrak skins may be worth the investment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another reason to choose CS:GO StatTrak™ skins is that they often hold higher value in the trading and selling market compared to regular skins. In case you are interested in the economics of CS:GO and possibly making a profit by selling or trading skins, StatTrak versions can be a worthy investment.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the other hand, StatTrak™ skins oftentimes cost more than their non-StatTrak versions. You should consider whether you are willing to spend more on these skins, especially if you are on a budget.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, is StatTrack™ worth it? If you appreciate visually appealing skins, take pride in your in-game achievements, enjoy the trading aspect of CS:GO, or simply love collecting rare items, then the answer could be yes. However, if these factors are not important to you, or if budget is a concern, then non-StatTrak™ skins might be a better fit for your gaming experience.\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"To_Wrap_Up\">\n</span>\n<strong>\n  To Wrap Up!\n </strong>\n<span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, the StatTrak™ technology will add a new layer to the gaming experience by tracking your successes and milestones.
