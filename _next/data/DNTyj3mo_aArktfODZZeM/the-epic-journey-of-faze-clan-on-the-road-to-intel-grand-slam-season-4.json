Despite a harsh start, FaZe Clan managed to do a comeback, easily winning the remaining two maps, Ancient (16:6) and Inferno (16:9), and closing the series with a 2:1 score.\n</p>\n<p>\n By that time, ropz was out of isolation. However, the next two group stage matches were the only series FaZe Clan played with their starting five.\n</p>\n<p>\n After knocking down Team Liquid to the Lower Bracket, FaZe Clan played against fnatic for a spot in the Group B Upper Final.
