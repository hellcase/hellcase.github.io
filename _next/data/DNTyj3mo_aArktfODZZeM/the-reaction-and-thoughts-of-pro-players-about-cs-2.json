In different series, this game has found millions of fans and has become one of the leading disciplines in eSports. But progress does not stand still, and we are all looking forward to the summer and the release of CS 2. While we wait for the release, let‚Äôs see what the pro players think about a CS 2 and how they think the new changes in the game will affect the professional scene.\n</p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\">\n<div>\n<p>\n   In article you will find:\n  </p>\n<span>\n</span>\n</div>\n<nav>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#The_Opinion_of_Pro_Players_About_CS_2\" title=\"The Opinion of Pro Players About CS 2\">\n     The Opinion of Pro Players About CS 2\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#Pro_Scene_Transition_to_CS_2\" title=\"Pro Scene Transition to CS 2\">\n     Pro Scene Transition to CS 2\n    </a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#To_Wrap_Up\" title=\"To Wrap Up!\">\n     To Wrap Up!\n    </a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"The_Opinion_of_Pro_Players_About_CS_2\">\n</span>\n The Opinion of Pro Players About CS 2\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n As it turned out, after the release of the CS 2 beta test, only a few players had the opportunity to test the new game. The rest just fueled the interest of their audience. But now we know that CS 2 will be released, almost all pro players have been given access to the beta, and that‚Äôs what they think. Let‚Äôs start with the opinion of the number one player in the game ‚Äì s1mple. On his stream, Sasha gives his comments:\n</p>\n<p>\n ‚ÄúYeah guys, I enjoy it. Everything is so accurate in this game, everything is so nice. In the middle of the screen, on the right side ‚Äì everything is perfect. Perfect with this classic color (means new graphic on Dust 2). But fps is too low.‚Äù\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCiH1mHKOVk?feature=oembed\" title=\"NAVI S1mple –í–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –ò–≥—Ä–∞–µ—Ç –≤ Counter Strike 2!\" width=\"640\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n<br>\n Well, this is not an optimized beta yet, so it‚Äôs not surprising that the FPS is low. We hope that Valve will fix everything by the release. S1mple‚Äôs former teammate ‚Äú\n \n  EliGE\n \n ‚Äú, also liked the new CS. You can see his emotions in this tweet:\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    CS 2 IS HERE AND IT LOOKS FKIN INSANEEEEE\n    <br>\n<br>\n    Graphics are so fking good, new mechanics. Hype as fuck üî•üî•üî•üòö\n   </p>\n   ‚Äî Jonathan Jablonowski (@EliGE)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EliGE/status/1638585721937174543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 22, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Marcelo ‚Äúcoldzera‚Äù David is also impressed by the new CS:\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"pt\">\n    Esse CS2 est√° maravilhoso üòç! Muita mudan√ßa positiva e o meta vai ser completamente diferente! O que voc√™s gostaram mais? ‚¨áÔ∏è\n   </p>\n   ‚Äî coldzera (@coldzera)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coldzera/status/1638588401824800793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 22, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n<br>\n Also, in response to another user under this tweet, coldzera shared his opinion about responsive smokes and the mechanics of their work. In his opinion, the fact that the smoke is no longer an obstacle makes life easier for the CT side and makes it harder for the attackers. The HE grenade now has a new ability to temporarily disperse smoke, which can break the plant‚Äôs execution during the final seconds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The new smoke will really change the way you play the game. But whether this new mechanic will give an advantage to one of the sides or if players will find an alternative way to use this mechanic, we will find out in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n Team Cloud9 player\n \n  Sergey ‚ÄúAx1Le‚Äù Rykhtorov\n \n was also skeptical about the new smoke grenade mechanics:\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Don‚Äôt do bullets which making a little holes in smokes ü•≤\n   </p>\n   ‚Äî Ax1Le (@Ax1LeGOD)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ax1LeGOD/status/1638625629632340018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 22, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n As much as Ax1Le wants Valve to listen to him, this is unlikely to happen. There is no doubt that the usual CS gameplay will change. The main question is who will be able to adapt faster and show better results. Will any team repeat or even surpass the NiP record streak of 87 won maps?\n</p>\n<h2>\n<span id=\"Pro_Scene_Transition_to_CS_2\">\n</span>\n Pro Scene Transition to CS 2\n <span>\n</span>\n</h2>\n<p>\n That has already happened in the history of the professional CS scene. After the release of CS:GO, players had to adapt to the new game. The difference between CS 1.6 and CS:GO versions was much greater than between CS:GO and CS2, but still, this transition entailed a total change in the pro scene at the time. How it will be this time, we will find out only after the pro scene moves over to the rails tracks of CS2, and this will happen pretty soon.\n</p>\n<p>\n The developers of CS2 made a statement on their official Twitter that BLAST.tv Paris Major 2023 will be the last tournament of this status held in the CS:GO version.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    The Paris Major will be the final CS:GO Major.\n    <br>\n<br>\n    The following Major will be in March 2024 and the first in Counter-Strike 2.\n   </p>\n   ‚Äî CS2 (@CounterStrike)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1639376904322162688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 24, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Blast‚Äôs representative also commented on that news:\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    Hard to fathom the responsibility on our shoulders with our Paris Major, being allowed to conclude on a legacy this great before a new journey in CS2 begins. Does it get bigger than this? I think not.\n    \n     https://t.co/SpP5tBTNHH\n    \n</p>\n   ‚Äî Nico üí• (@nicothepops)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nicothepops/status/1639386839973806081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 24, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n As we can see, the pro teams don‚Äôt have much time left to prepare for CS2, considering that they still need to finish the last tournaments in the CS:GO version. Meanwhile, the first show match in CS2 took place in Malta before the ESL Pro League Season 17 finals.

That would be very interesting to watch. In the meantime, when some are preparing for the upcoming CS:GO tournaments, some have already set goals for themselves in CS2.\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    LFT, aiming for 88 straight wins in CS2\n   </p>\n   ‚Äî Adam Friberg (@fribergCS)\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fribergCS/status/1638587566902452237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">\n    March 22, 2023\n   </a>\n</blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n</script>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>\n Of course, this is more of a joke from a former NiP player with reference to the record. A post in a similar style was posted on Twitter by the legendary ‚Äúheadshot machine‚Äù ‚Äì Adil ‚ÄúScreaM‚Äù Benrlitom:\n</p>\n<figure>\n<div>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n    People forget I played CS since 2005  12 years as a professional, played 8 majors.
