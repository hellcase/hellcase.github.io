 Top Seven AK-47 Skins Under $10
 <span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 AK-47 is the most popular weapon in the game, and it’s a well-known gun in the real world. In CS:GO, it is exclusively available to the Terrorists team.
</p>
<p>
<em>
  “Powerful and reliable, the AK-47 is one of the most popular assault rifles in the world. It is most deadly in short, controlled bursts of fire.”
 </em>
 – Valve.
</p>
<p>
 This is a powerful weapon, and it can guarantee you a one-tap frag when hitting a helmeted enemy player with a headshot. While AK-47 is great for taking long-distance fights firing in short bursts, its recoil is too high to control when firing long bursts.
</p>

<p>
 Having a stylish and eye-catching skin for the iconic AK-47 is a must for every self-respecting CS:GO player. Now, let’s find out what are the greatest AK-47 skins under $10. Take notes!

 The CS:GO players first got to try out the surrealistic
 <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Phantom Disruptor
 </a>
 when the Prisma 2 Collection came out in March, 2020. This skin is a community-made one, and it is Apel’s creation.
</p>
<p>
 On the black matte base of this AK-47 skin, the author depicted a wolf mutated into a mist-form illusion creature. The color palette consists of soft pastel hues of beige, yellow, blue, and orange.
</p>
<p>
 AK-47 | Phantom Disruptor in Battle-Scarred condition costs less than 6$, and a Minimal Wear variant is $9.30.

<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Cartel
 </a>
 is created by Hanzo, Coyote, and Ander, and Valve released it within the Chroma Case in January, 2015.
</p>
<p>
 Clearly inspired by Mexican culture and the Day of the Dead in particular, this AK-47 skin is embellished with a variety of engraved designs on it, including styled skulls, flowers, and slithering snakes. The base was not painted, and the wooden textures of the gun’s handle and the buttstock are also untouched.
</p>
<p>
 To stay within your budget, get the AK-47 | Cartel in Battle-Scarred condition for $7.10, or go for a Well-Worn one that costs $9.90. Since it has the Patina finish style, the skin looks great in all conditions, the metal only gets darker on
 
  higher wear levels

 Valve released the extra-black
 <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Slate
 </a>
 as a part of the Snakebite Case when the CS:GO’s tenth operation, Operation Broken Fang, ended at the beginning of May, 2020. This skin was created by Redesired.
</p>
<p>
 The whole assault rifle is covered in matte slate black paint, and it was given a patinated look. Embossed elements added to some of the firearm’s components are a nice touch-up, their purpose is to allow a better grip and assist in controlling the recoil. However, remember that CS:GO skins are purely cosmetic items, and equipping them will not give you any technical advantage in-game.
</p>
<p>
 The Battle-Scarred&nbsp;AK-47 | Slate&nbsp;is worth $3.50, and a Minimal Wear variant sells for $5.70. If you are okay with going over the budget a little bit, go for the Factory New skin that costs $11.50. There are also StatTrak™ options under $10: BS, WW, and FT.

<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Rat Rod
 </a>
 was released within the operation-exclusive weapon case when Operation Shattered Web started in November, 2019. This finish was created by DasDas, Des, and Mia.
</p>
<p>
 Rumors say this weapon was found in a junkyard in the wasteland. The new owner painted various motifs over the original dark blue base coat and treated the gun with patina to make it chemically aged. On the rifle’s body, the author depicted a monster’s bloody gaping maw with sharp fangs shown. On other parts of the AK-47 | Rat Rod, there is a number of painting imitating paper stickers.
</p>
<p>
 AK-47 | Rat Rod costs less than $10 in any condition, so just go ahead and get whatever feels right. If you want a StatTrak™ variant, you can buy a Battle-Scarred one for $9.60 or a Well-Worn one for $9.95.

<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Blue Laminate
 </a>
 is a Valve-made skin, and it was added to CS:GO within one of the oldest weapon cases, eSports 2013 Case, in December, 2013.
</p>
<p>
 The body of this AK-47 and its magazine are untouched. The wooden components, meaning the handle, the buttstock, and the handguard, were given a laminate stick using a hydrographic painting technique. While this skin features wavy lines of blue colors, there are also skins like this in a green, red, and black palette.
</p>
<p>
 The Battle-Scarred condition is impossible for AK-47 | Blue Laminate, but you can get a Field-Tested variant for $8.30 or a Minimal Wear one for $8.90. If you’re willing to go over the $10 budget, go for a Factory New skin that costs $10.40.

 Here’s another masterpiece by Apel. We first got to play with
 <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Legion of Anubis
 </a>
 when Valve released it as a part of the Fracture Case in August, 2020.
</p>
<p>
 Inspired by the CS:GO’s map Anubis, ancient Egypt mythology, and the ‘Magic The Gathering’ series, the author of AK-47 | Legion of Anubis made a detailed composition picturing Egyptian gods: Anubis in the front and Ra in the background. The design is complemented with ancient symbols, inscriptions, a pharaoh, and a mummy on the buttstock with an eye glowing vibrant red.
</p>
<p>
 A Battle-Scarred AK-47 | Legion of Anubis will cost you $9.20, but in this condition, the painting is almost completely erased. Consider getting at least a Well-Worn skin, its price goes over the budget just a little.
</p>

 Starting price: $1.20.
</p>
<p>
 A Mil-Spec skin from the Chroma 2 Case,
 <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  AK-47 | Elite Build
 </a>
 , was released in April, 2015. This is a community-made finish, and M1nDdesigns created it.
</p>
<p>
 The body of this weapon is decorated with a dark gray camouflage-styled pattern, and its wooden components, except for the handle, are painted black. There are also light orange heat-transferred decals: inscriptions “AiM PRECISION”, “MASTERY SERIE”, “PROGAMING”, icons, and lines.
</p>
<p>
 The lowest price for the AK-47 | Elite Build is $1.20, but in Factory New condition, it costs $5.50. So just get the float you like more. If you want your skin to have a StatTrak™ feature, any skin up to Minimal Wear ones will fit the budget of $10.
