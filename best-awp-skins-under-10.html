  A Brief Overview of AWP Skins
 </strong>
<span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 AWP is one of the most popular weapons presented in the game, and the CS:GO players hugely appreciate this sniper rifle for its power. However, to keep things balanced, the AWP skins have a poor firing rate and slow reload speed. Unlike some of the other firearms, this one is available for both the Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist sides in-game.

  “High risk and high reward, the infamous AWP is recognizable by its signature report and one-shot, one-kill policy.”

<p>
 Being a sniper is a responsible role that suits bold and skilled players. We shared tips on becoming the best sniper in our article about
 <a href="https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  mastering different playstyles
 </a>
 . AWP skins are one of the most expensive weapons in CS:GO, meaning it is very important for its owner to justify such an investment by utilizing the weapon effectively and making an impact on winning the round.
</p>
<p>
 In 2022, Valve nerfed the AWP by reducing its magazine capacity from ten rounds to a maximum of five. However, players are still very fond of this weapon, and skins for it, unsurprisingly, are in high demand.
</p>
<p>
 While some of the AWP skins’ prices are astronomically high, there are still affordable options that won’t break the bank. Let’s take a closer look at the seven best CS:GO for AWP skins under $10.

  AWP | Acheron
 </a>
 is one of the best skins within its price range. It was released in the 2018 Nuke Collection in September, 2018.
</p>
<p>
 The base of this AWP is painted in light gray and dark blue, and its body is complemented by a number of different skulls with hazard signs on their foreheads and bones around them. The barrel and the scope of the weapon are untouched.
</p>
<p>
 AWP | Acheron is available in all conditions, and its price varies from $1.30 for a Battle-Scarred variant to $3.65 for a Factory New one. There are also Souvenir skins, but unfortunately, they do not fit the budget of ten dollars.

  AWP | Worm God
 </a>
 has been in the game for quite a long time now. Valve released this community-created skin in the Chroma 2 Case in April, 2015. It is created by enzYm.
</p>
<p>
 A huge motif of a white skull resides on the sniper rifle’s buttstock, but it’s only visible when you inspect the weapon in-game. It has been painted over the white-to-olive gradient base and intertwining roots using high-durability enamel paints.
</p>
<p>
 This skin has a Patina finish style, meaning it looks great in all its conditions. The price of the Well-Worn variant is $1.90. You can even get a StatTrak™ Factory New AWP | Worm God and still stay within your budget, as it costs only $7.50.

 in your inventory? This skin is Danidem’s creation, and it was released as a part of the Horizon Case in August, 2018.
</p>
<p>
 Fifty-two vibrant-colored cats and pugs are the main characters in this design. They are cartoon-styled, and there are so many of them! Also, one of the animals painted on the buttstock looks like a spy because of the sunglasses and a mask. Want to bet if it’s a cat or a dog? There are a lot of easter eggs hidden in the design, including a DOTA 2 hero,
 
  Bounty Hunter
 
 .
</p>
<p>
 You can get a Battle-Scarred AWP | PAW for $2.25, but we would recommend going for a Factory New variant as it costs only $5.60. If you want your skin to feature StatTrak™, get a Minimal Wear one for $9.50.

 is less than two years old, and it is still popular among players. It was released as a part of the 2021 Train Collection when Operation Riptide started in September, 2021. This is a community-made skin designed by Chemical Alia.
</p>
<p>
 The core of this AWP skin’s techno-inspired design is an abstract geometric pattern. The author used a hydrographic technique to apply it to the weapon’s white base. It is detailed with various inscriptions.
</p>
<p>
 Battle-Scarred variants of this skin do not exist. You can get a Well-Worn AWP | POP AWP for $2.60 or go for a Factory New skin that will cost you $5.35. StatTrak™ is not available for this skin.

  AWP | Atheris
 </a>
 is a community-made skin contributed by Graff. Valve added this weapon finish to the Prisma Case and released it in March, 2019.
</p>
<p>
 As the flavor text says, this AWP skin is truly as beautiful as it is deadly. Atheris, an African bush viper, embellishes the black-and-blue base of the sniper rifle’s body. The author hand-painted the slithering snake in shades of green and blue and added details in the form of scales to the weapon’s scope.
</p>
<p>
 The price of Battle-Scarred variants of AWP | Atheris is $2.60. Although the snake is still visible on high float levels, it is better to get this skin in Field-Tested condition for $4 or a Minimal Wear one for $6.90.
</p>
<p>
 The best condition of AWP | Atheris with StatTrak™ feature that fits the budget of $10 is Field-Tested, and it sells for a bit less than $9.

</p>
<p>
 The pattern of this weapon finish was custom-painted with crayon drawings in pink, purple, and blue. There are motifs of an eye, sad faces, monsters, fangs, and other icons. The design is also complemented with inscriptions such as “LIVING DEAD”, “WOLVES ARE AT MY DOOR”, “#HEADSHOT”, and “NO MORE”. The only untouched part of the sniper rifle is the barrel.

  AWP | Elite Build
 </a>
 is a community-made skin contributed by M1nDdesigns. Valve released this finish alongside Operation Wildfire in the eponymous operation-exclusive case in February, 2016.
</p>
<p>
 This is a skin from the Elite Build family that also features skins for AK-47 and P90, and all of them are stylish and affordable. The author complemented the AWP’s body with a camouflage-styled abstract pattern and applied various details in the form of icons and inscriptions, combining hydrographic techniques and careful stenciling. The light orange accents complete the pattern.
</p>
<p>
 A Battle-Scarred AWP | Elite Build will cost you $8.99. However, it might be worth considering getting at least a Well-Worn variant that exceeds our budget of $10 by fifty cents.

  How to Save Money On CS:GO Skins?
 </strong>
<span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 Having an inventory stocked with high-end weapon skins is a dream many CS:GO players wish would come true for them. However, the value of CS:GO cosmetics can be manipulated and artificially inflated, and it’s leading to the majority of players not being able to afford nice-looking skins.
</p>
<p>
 The market is filled with overpriced skins, and this is one of the factors that keep away players on a budget from obtaining nice skins. Offers on the
 <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">
  Steam Community Market
 </a>
 are often the highest, and that’s why people now use third-party websites to buy, sell, and trade their items.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://r.4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a> is a CS:GO <a href="https://www.4tmr.com/best-csgo-case-opening-sites" target="_blank">case opening</a> Website that offers affordable cases with high chances of dropping CS:GO skins of high value. The odds of claiming a certain item from a case are publicly displayed in percentage rates, so you always know what you invest in.
</p>
<p>
 Just imagine getting a fresh AWP | Wildfire by spinning a $4.50 case! The Universal Love Case has a big chance of dropping this skin for you. Also, it contains M4A4 | Neo-Noir, Paracord Knife | Blue Steel, AK-47 | Leet Museo, and other awesome CS:GO skins. Definitely worth a try!
