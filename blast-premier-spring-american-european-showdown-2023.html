<p>
 In the final match against paiN, Imperial probably didn’t get the lead they hoped for on Inferno, as both teams seemed evenly matched. By halftime, it was 7-8 in favor of Imperial, but paiN held their ground and won seven rounds. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough for them, and after eight more rounds, Imperial won 16-14.

<p>
 On Mirage, paiN started strong and won eight rounds, but Imperial also put up a good fight and won seven rounds. However, in the second half, paiN only managed to win one round. Imperial easily won round after round and won the map, the series, and the

</p>
<p>
 Marcelo “chelo” Cespedes and Gabriel ‘FalleN’ Toledo made multi-frags, which contributed to their win, especially. Unfortunately, only Rodrigo ‘biguzera’ Bittencourt had a positive rating for paiN, while the players on Imperial put on a nice play.
</p>
<p>
 Imperial won the final with a 2:0 score. Here are the results of each map:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Inferno: 16-14 Imperial won.
 </li>

  Mirage: 16-9 Imperial won.

<p>
 The match continued on Vertigo, and BIG was stronger than their opponents in the first half. They took the lead on the enemy’s map with a score of 9-6. However, Cloud9 woke up and caught up with BIG, winning ten rounds to tie the score. Again, Nils ‘k1to’ Gruhne showed a wonderful play with two 1v2 clutches! On the T-side, BIG could only win two more rounds before Cloud9 took the map 16-11.
</p>
<p>
 Cloud9 completely dominated the decisive map and won the BLAST Premier Spring Showdown 2023 Europe, and advanced to the Spring Final.

<p>
 The BLAST Premier is an important series of tournaments for CS:GO, significantly impacting the scene in European and American regions. It is a prestigious event in Europe that includes top teams and winning is a significant achievement.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, CS:GO’s lower popularity and fewer teams in America make the BLAST Premier’s impact smaller. Nevertheless, the tournament’s broadcast increases the game’s popularity in the region.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, the tournament offers a large prize pool, attracting top-tier talent and ensuring fierce competition.
