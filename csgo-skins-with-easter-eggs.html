  What Are Easter Eggs in CS:GO?
 </strong>
<span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 Easter eggs are secret features or surprises in video games intentionally hidden by developers. Oftentimes, these hidden surprises are meant to be discovered by players and can be a nod to pop culture, inside jokes, or references to other games. Easter eggs enhance the gameplay experience by adding an element of fun, humor, or curiosity to the content.
</p>
<p>
 The term “easter egg” comes from the tradition of hiding easter eggs during Easter celebrations, where participants search for the hidden eggs as part of the festivities. Similarly, easter eggs in video games involve a sense of discovery and excitement for those players who uncover them.

<p>
 Everyone loves easter eggs! In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, there are numerous easter eggs spread throughout the game, including those hidden in the designs of weapon skins. Some of the community artists who create CS:GO skins have shown a keen eye for detail that sets their work apart from the rest, and we have found ten awesome easter eggs. These skins can become quite popular amongst players and collectors alike, with some of them featuring

  Galil AR | Chatterbox
 </a>
 was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a part of The Chroma Collection in January 2015. The author covered some parts of the weapon with yellow paint and adorned the receiver with an image of a cartoon-styled white skull.
</p>
<p>
 Several easter eggs are hidden in the Galil AR | Chatterbox design. First, there is a “FEED ME” inscription on the back part of the receiver, you can spot it while inspecting the rifle. Also, with each bullet you fire, the skull opens its mouth, creating an illusion of being alive and chattering.
</p>
<p>
 No Factory New and Minimal Wear variants of

 Added to the game in the Prisma 2 Collection in 2020, R8 Revolver | Bone Forged was created by Mysterion and Blazer. The pistol has been custom painted with copper paint, distressed, and adorned with an ancient sea monster engraved motif.
</p>
<p>
 The
 <a href="https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  R8 Revolver | Bone Forged
 </a>
 skin in CS:GO is a prime example of how attention to detail can elevate a design from ordinary to extraordinary. One such detail is the engraved inscription “HUNGRY” on each bullet. This seemingly small element adds a layer of depth and meaning to the overall aesthetic, making it a beautiful and standout feature.
</p>
<p>
 Another interesting feature of this skin is that with a higher wear level, the body of the revolver turns dark blue.
</p>
<p>
 This Mil-Spec is extremely affordable, costing only $0.10 in Battle-Scarred condition and around $0.30 in Factory New condition. StatTrak™ Factory New

  АК-47 | Cartel
 </a>
 , created by coyote37, Anders, and Hanzo, was first introduced to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a part of The Chroma Collection in January 2015. While the metal components of the assault rifle are not painted, the authors engraved them with motifs of flowers, stylized skulls, and snakes and coated them with a layer of patina.
</p>
<p>
 Quite a few easter eggs are hidden within the design of the AK-47 | Cartel. First of all, there is a symbol resembling an Illuminati sign engraved on the front sight component of the rifle.
</p>
<p>
 Then, there is an inscription that says “Hasta Siempre”. It is a reference to a song called “Hasta Siempre, Comandante”, which is a reply to revolutionary Che Guevara’s farewell letter when he left Cuba and was killed. The name of the song translates as “Until Forever, Commander”.
</p>
<p>
 Pricing of the basic variants of Patina-styled
 <strong>
  АК-47 | Cartel
 </strong>
 vary from $9.95 for Battle-Scarred condition to almost $40 for Factory New condition. StatTrak™ Factory New AK-47 Cartel costs $100, but you can get it for $ only from our Case.

</p>
<p>
 While this AWP skin is extremely popular due to its eye-catching design and affordability, not all its owners know that an easter egg is hidden in the design. When you reload your sniper rifle, watch for a heart motif painted on the magazine.
</p>
<p>
 Battle-Scared variants of AWP | Capillary cost $0.35, and Factory New ones sell for $3.65. Pricing of StatTrak™ skins ranges from $1.70 to $13.50.

</p>
<p>
 The overall design is accentuated by small, hand-drawn details, including skulls, a smiley face, and a sequence of numbers “7355608” representing the bomb code. It is a small but great detail. Also, there are inscriptions like “the pizza is a lie”, which refers to the games called

 when it was released as a part of The Chroma Case in April 2015. This skin is the creation of LoveCroissant. The main body of the automatic rifle is covered in white paint, while various sections of the weapon are finished in a striking green hue.
</p>
<p>
 The easter egg of Galil AR | Eco is hidden in the bar code, which includes a bomb defusal code decorating the central portion of the receiver. There are also a recycling icon near the magazine of the rile and an “ECO IND.” inscription on the buttstock.
</p>
<p>
 There are no Factory New variants of the skin. It sells for $2.60 in Battle-Scarred condition and $31.70 with a Minimal Wear float value. StatTrak™ Field-Tested

</p>
<p>
 If you are looking for an easter egg in the design of this shotgun skin, you are looking in the wrong place. It is actually hidden in the flavor text which says “Mine.” The name of the MAG-7 | Seabird skin appears to be a clear nod to Pixar’s Finding Nemo. In the movie, the seagulls are known for their repetitive and iconic screaming of “Mine! Mine! Mine!”.

 is a community-made skin designed by EGO DEATH. It was added to the game alongside other finishes from the Prisma Case in March 2019. The shotgun features a design depicting a creature that looks like an alligator breathing fire. This striking and creative illustration adds an eye-catching element to the weapon’s appearance.

 Just like with MAG-7 | Seabird, the easter egg of XM1014 | Incinegator is hidden within its flavor text, “Boom. Bam. Bop… Pow.” It is a nod to a popular video of a rap battle parody that became a meme. Skip the video to 4:00 to see the SupaHotFire’s punch line the author of this shotgun skin referred to.

 The easter egg of Tec-9 | Hades uncovers with a higher wear level value of the skin. Starting with Field-Tested, one of the helmets depicted on the rubber insert of the handle turns into a skull. The more paint is gone, the more skulls appear on the pistol.
