 The

 </strong>
 contract&nbsp;service works on the principle of a fair exchange. With this service, the player can exchange up to ten game items of one category for an item of a higher category. His choice is due to some probabilities. There are three modes of participation in the&nbsp;<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a> trade-up
 <strong>
</strong>
 contract service – Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each mode has its own financial limits, however, it allows users to get a more valuable item as a result of the exchange.

<p>
 In order to take part in the exchange of game items, you need to go to your personal
 <strong>
<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a>
</strong>
 profile and find the “Contract” tab. Thanks to the colorful and clear design, you will quickly find the control panel for the item exchange process. Here you can select the desired mode and add the items you would like to exchange. Please note that the page has a switch for selecting items for three games: CS:GO, Dota, and Rush. When you select a game, you will have access to the attributes available in your inventory.
</p>
<p>
 For the convenience of users, there is a kind of calculator on the page. You can track the cost of the items selected for the exchange and the cost of the item (cost range) that you will receive after the procedure of the
 <strong>
<a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a> trade-up contract
 </strong>
 service is completed. The greater the total cost of the selected items, the more valuable new items users can get.
</p>
<p>
 You can use a maximum of ten items to trade at a time, but you must select at least three items. In the easy mode, the minimum value of items should be $0,30 and the maximum value should be $1000. In the medium mode, the minimum value of items should be $0.60 and the maximum value should be $200. In the hard mode, the minimum price of items should reach $1, and the maximum price should be $400.

 The Trade Up Contact service is <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a>’s unique offering for players who value inventory order and individual style. The service is worth it to use, as you can get

 <span>

</h2>
<p>
 For many CS:GO players, it is important to have valuable items in their inventory that will accurately demonstrate their playing style and capabilities in the game to the opponent. If you keep skins in your collection that you would like to exchange for more unique attributes, you should
 <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">
  visit the&nbsp;Hellcase Contract&nbsp;tab
 </a>
 . You can exchange up to ten items at a time. It is worth noting that the Trade Up Contract service allows the user to get a knife skin in exchange for unnecessary items. <a href="https://4tr.cc/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a> introduced the opportunity to win a knife as part of the service on April 1, 2016. CS:GO players have a chance to get a knife when exchanging several skins. You just need to select game attributes and click on the “Sign contract” button.
</p>
<p>
 A few seconds after signing the contract, a window opens with the name, cost, and image of the skin. The player can do several things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  take part in the signing of the contract.
 </li>
<li>
  sell skin.
 </li>
<li>
  go to the section with all items.
 </li>
<li>
  go to the “Upgrade” tab.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 The “Upgrade” service provides users with a chance to increase the value of any CS:GO, Rush, or Dota item. The player can choose the item he would like to replace and the item he would like to receive as a result. In addition to the item, you can use the game balance. An important factor for the successful outcome is the choice of upgrade multiplier (RANDOM X, 1.5X, 2X, 5X, 10X). Success in this “game” depends on the chosen options and the luck of the user
