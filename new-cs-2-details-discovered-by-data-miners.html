 Ladies and gentlemen, Counter-Strike 2 is real and launching this summer. We have already covered the announcement of the biggest update, peeked at the first gameplay streams, and found the best memes about CS2 yet.
</p>
<p>
 Data miners dedicate hours examining the game’s files to find interesting insights on what to expect in the near future updates. Today, we will look at the latest findings by dedicated data miners.

 Who Are Data Miners?
 <span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 Data miners are individuals or teams using various tools and data mining techniques to extract and analyze game data based on information gathered from the game’s files, servers, or other sources. Data mining is a way to find clues on upcoming game updates and provide insights about the game’s mechanics.
</p>
<p>
 We have scoured the web to bring you the latest finding of data miners who have been examining the Counter-Strike 2 game files since the start of the Limited Test. Here, we will find out about new knife styles, possible Danger Zone updates, and much more.
</p>
<h2>
<span id="New_Knives">
</span>
 New Knives
 <span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 Data miners found information about two knives that might be added to Counter-Strike 2. One is called Twinblade, and the other is called Kukri.
</p>
<h3>
<span id="Twinblade_Knife">

 In our opinion, Twinblade is an eye-catching knife worth paying attention to. it is possible that it will become one of the most popular knives once released.

 VAC Update

</h2>
<p>
 Right now, if a player gets banned by the Valve Anti-Cheat system while he is playing the game, he gets disconnected from the server, but the remaining players must continue playing until the end of the match.
</p>
<p>
 The latest findings by data miners suggest that this is going to change in Counter-Strike 2. The new anti-cheat measure called “VAC Live” that might be implemented will cancel the match if a cheater is detected.

 If Valve implements this feature, it will surely receive a lot of positive feedback from the community. Unfortunately, cheaters are a big problem in CS:GO, so it is necessary to take all the measures to minimize their presence in Counter-Strike 2.

 Is Counter-Strike 2: Mobile Real?
 <span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 It feels unbelievable, but according to information that data miners dug from the game’s files, Counter-Strike 2 might get a mobile version sometime in the future. If there were only rumors about it a year ago, it is now confirmed that Counter-Strike 2: Mobile is on the developers’ tables.

<p>
 These claims are based on the fact that the Source 2 engine supports iOS and Android and on pieces of code found in the game’s files and three Developer Console commands in Counter-Strike 2.
</p>
<p>
 Our prediction is that the mobile version of Counter-Strike 2 will be popular if ever released. Imagine always having your favorite game in your pocket wherever you go!
</p>
<p>
 Since a lot of PC games like Fortnite, PUBG, and CoD have been released as mobile versions, maybe it’s finally time for CS2 to get one. The only question is, who reaches this point first, Valve or Riot?

<p>
 Yes, the new radio announcements are coming to Counter-Strike 2 in male and female voices. Also, it looks like you will be able to choose different Announcers in-game in the Settings tab.
</p>
<figure>
<div>
<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-width="550">

    Seems like in Counter-Strike 2 you will be able to choose between Announcers straight from the Settings (check QRT for audio preview)!
    <br>

    This opens up the possibility for new cosmetics type: Announcer Packs (like in Dota). Imagine GabeN or GLaDOS saying: "Bomb has been planted".

<p>
 Should we expect custom Announcer Packs like in DOTA 2? They even have a Rick &amp; Morty Announcement Pack, and it might be a great idea to implement these in Counter-Strike 2.

 Moaning is back in Counter-Strike 2! Use the commands and the instructions given in the following tweet to be able to moan in your games.

 If moaning is not as funny to you after all these years, you can look for other amusing voice lines by other agents. Here is an example voice line of SEAL Frogman | Skipper Davida “Goggles” Fernandez you can use in your games if you have this agent in your arsenal.

 It would be simply unfair to leave Danger Zone enjoyers without updates in Counter-Strike 2. Danger Zone is a Battle Royal mode in CS:GO, and it looks like new stuff is coming to freshen up the gameplay.

 This is definitely for Danger Zone, though, right? We really hope it is because the thought of seeing this in regular matchmaking is actually terrifying.

<p>
 Currently, the Counter-Strike 2 Limited Test only offers a well-known Deathmatch Mode and an Unrated 5×5 Mode on de_dust2. However, with new maps added, we might also play the updated Danger Zone before the official Counter-Strike 2 launch in the summer.

 It is necessary to understand that Valve mentioned nothing concerning the new operation officially yet, so anything the data miner found might be reworked or canceled. Either way, a new Operation seems to be a great way to kick off the release of Counter-Strike 2!

 However, the official Counter-Strike Twitter account replied to the leak with a picture of two real pins designed like well-known, existing stickers.

 Custom sprays used to be and are still popular thing on public servers in Counter-Strike 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source. Custom sprays are easy to make and upload in these games, and are a great way to add a little fun to your gaming experience.

<p>
 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, however, does not offer a feature for uploading custom graffiti sprays. The only sprays you can use in-game are Valve-made, and you can receive them as in-game drops and buy them on Steam Market or third-party websites.
</p>
<p>
 Also, unlike CS 1.6 and CS:S sprays, the CS:GO sprays are consumable. You can only use a spray 50 times before you need to get a new one.
</p>
<p>
 Although you will most likely not be able to use custom graffiti sprays in Counter-Strike 2, it is still great that community-made sprays may be presented in the Steam Workshop and eventually added to the game.
</p>
<p>
 Do you have any ideas for a new custom graffiti spray already? Get ready because it seems that Steam Workshop will be flooded with those after Counter-Strike 2 launches in the summer.

 Prodigy Remake in Counter-Strike 2

<p>
 Does anyone here remembers the map called Prodigy? First appeared in Counter-Strike BETA 4.0, it was one of the first-ever bomb defusal maps of the series alongside Dust and Nuke. Initially, developers planned to add it to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but this never happened.
</p>
<p>
 And although de_prodigy never appeared in CS:GO, there is a slight chance this map might be rebuilt for Counter-Strike 2.

 It is not known for sure whether Agent Crates are coming to Counter-Strike 2 or Valve just experimented with this idea at some point in the past.

 In CS:GO, you can obtain agents by exchanging stars earned for completing tasks within the specific Operation, buy them on Steam Market, or get them o third-party platforms like <a href="https://www.4tmr.com/r/XnabMPWX" target="_blank">Hellcase</a>. Check out the
