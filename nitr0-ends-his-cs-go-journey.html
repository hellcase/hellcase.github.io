  Nick ‚Äúnitr0‚Äù Cannellan‚Äôs Journey in eSports
 </strong>
<span>
</span>
</h2>
<p>
 The story of ‚Äúnitr0‚Äù as a player for Team Liquid began back in 2015 when Team Liquid entered the world of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive by signing a young team called ‚ÄúChill Guys‚Äù consisting of adreN, daps, FugLy, NAF, and nitr0.
</p>
<p>
 The team, including ‚Äúnitr0,‚Äù competed in tournaments for almost a year. Still, they achieved significant success on July 10, 2016, when they secured 2nd place at the ESL One: Cologne 2016, earning a prize of $150,000. From there, Team Liquid participated in many tournaments but mostly secured 4th or 5th place during 2016-2017.
</p>
<p>
 Their true success story began with the ESL Pro League Season 7, where they showcased impressive gameplay and continued to perform well in subsequent tournaments:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

   The Esports Championship Series Season 5
  
  ‚Äì 2nd place ($120,000)
 </li>
<li>

   The ELEAGUE CS:GO Premier 2018
  
  ‚Äì 2nd place ($200,000)
 </li>
<li>

   The ESL Pro League Season 8
  
  ‚Äì 2nd place ($100,000)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 With each tournament, the team grew stronger, improved their gameplay, and gained more confidence. The turning point for Team Liquid came with their 1st place finish at the&nbsp;Intel Extreme Masters XIV. Following this victory, the team was powerful. They went on to win the&nbsp;DreamHack Masters Dallas 2019, the&nbsp;ESL Pro League Season 9, and needed one more victory to claim the prestigious&nbsp;Intel Grand Slam&nbsp;award and $1,000,000.
</p>
<p>
 They managed to do it. Their triumph came at&nbsp;ESL One: Cologne 2019, earning $125,000 and capturing the most coveted prize in CS:GO, the Intel Grand Slam. Although Team Liquid continued to perform well, this period was their most memorable and successful.

 Nitr0 has been a member of Team Liquid since January 2015. In the summer of 2020, he took a break and briefly switched to Valorant, but he returned to CS:GO in January 2022. Nick achieved remarkable success throughout his time with the team, winning multiple tournaments and even securing the prestigious
 
  Intel Grand Slam
 
 title.

 Also, in an interview with Dust2.Us, Nick said, ‚ÄúI am retiring from CS:GO, but I am open to considering options in other games. If I receive offers, I will evaluate them. After the tournament, I will start streaming because I don‚Äôt know what else I can do now. I am not ready to actively search for another team in CS:GO. I will be streaming Valorant and CS 2 when it comes out. Let‚Äôs see how everything unfolds.‚Äù

 Eventually, our beloved game‚Äôs legends fade from the professional stage. However, that doesn‚Äôt signify their disappearance, as thanks to tournament organizers who frequently host show matches, we will undoubtedly witness Nick on the grand stage. There are still many tournaments ahead, and with the upcoming release of CS2, new legends may already be emerging and delivering us the most thrilling emotions!
