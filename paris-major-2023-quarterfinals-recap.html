<p>
 Monte is a relatively young Ukrainian team that has played over 100 official matches to secure a spot in the Quarterfinals of the BLAST.tv Paris Major 2023. Let’s see if this young team was able to go against GamerLegion and move forward in the tournament.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s the list of map selections and bans:

 Starting as terrorists in the first half, Monte had a decent start, securing two rounds. However, they faced several setbacks and were trailing with a 2:6 score.

</p>
<p>
 After their impressive comeback in the first half, fans chanted “Monte” and had high hopes for their team’s victory. However, GamerLegion proved stronger on this map and ultimately won with a 16:10 score.

<p>
 The final match of the quarterfinals featured Team Liquid against Apeks. Experts were predicting a straightforward 2:0 victory for Liquid. But is it who this game ended? Let’s dive in and see what unfolded during the match.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s the list of map selections and bans:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Apeks removed Nuke

<li>

<li>

<p>
 It’s quite surprising that Team Liquid allowed Apeks to pick Ancient, considering Apeks’ impressive performance on this map. In the first half, Apeks dominated with an 11:4 score, dealing a significant blow to Liquid and their morale. Despite Liquid’s efforts to stage a comeback in the second half, they couldn’t turn the tide, and Apeks confidently secured the first map with a final 16:10 score.
