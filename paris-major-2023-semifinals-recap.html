</p>
<p>
 Let’s review these matches and see how it all went.

 GamerLegion picked Ancient. They started on the T side and successfully planted the bomb in the first three rounds. However, Heroic managed to eliminate their entire team and defuse the bomb without much difficulty in these rounds. GamerLegion had a good eco round to maintain their economy.
</p>
<p>
 They then went on to win six consecutive rounds, turning the score from 3:0 to 3:6 in their favor. Although Heroic had opportunities to win more rounds, GamerLegion’s teamwork prevented them from doing so. The first half ended with GamerLegion leading 10:5.

 The second half of the first map started well for Heroic as they won the pistol round playing as terrorists. It was a crucial victory for Heroic, and they continued their success by winning seven rounds in a row. It equalized the score and gave them a two-round advantage over GamerLegion, with a 12:10 score. GamerLegion tried to turn the game around, but Heroic pushed them and ultimately finished the first map with a 16:13 score.

 Although Heroic picked Inferno for their match against GamerLegion, the latter team had much experience playing on this map against strong opponents. It set the stage for a tense and highly competitive match. Initially, Heroic had a smooth start, securing the first four rounds on the T side.
</p>
<p>
 However, in the fifth round, GamerLegion won their first round and stabilized their economy. What followed was an incredible comeback by GamerLegion, winning eight consecutive rounds and ending the first half with a 9:6 lead in their favor.

 After switching sides, Heroic defended and patiently waited for GamerLegion to make mistakes. This decision proved successful as Heroic won the first five rounds, taking the score to 11:9 in their favor. However, GamerLegion called for a tactical pause.
</p>
<p>
 Their adjustments paid off as they won the subsequent rounds, ultimately closing out the second map with a 16:14 score. Then, narrowly avoiding defeat, they secured the map point and advanced to a decisive third map.

 Vitality vs Apeks

</h3>
<p>
 A French team was playing in the second semifinal match at Accor Arena in Paris, and the atmosphere in the crowd was incredible. Most fans wore branded yellow and black Vitality shirts, creating a visually striking scene. The stands resounded with chants and slogans dedicated to their team, demonstrating the immense support for Vitality. However, with this overwhelming support comes a great sense of responsibility for the team.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s the list of map selections and bans:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Apeks removed Nuke
 </li>
<li>
  Vitality removed Ancient
 </li>
<li>
  Apeks picked Mirage
 </li>
<li>
  Vitality picked Vertigo
 </li>

  Vitality removed Anubis
 </li>
<li>
  Apeks removed Overpass
 </li>
<li>
  Inferno was left over
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
 Apeks picked Mirage for the match because Vitality banned Ancient, which Apeks performs well on. Now, let’s focus on the game itself. In the first half, Vitality played on the CT side and started strongly by winning the first four rounds. They felt confident on this map, but Apeks rallied and showed their capabilities.
</p>
<p>
 Both teams played evenly, with the score tied at 7:7 after fourteen rounds. However, in the fifteenth round, Dan ‘apEX’ Madesclaire’s triple kill gave Vitality a slight edge, ending the first half on the first map with a narrow lead of 8:7.

 After switching sides, Vitality started strong with an excellent pistol round and won the next two. However, their success was halted when Apeks returned with a full buy in the fourth round, overpowering Vitality. The second half was equally tense, as both teams fought back and forth, showing no clear advantage.
</p>
<p>
 Eventually, Vitality emerged victorious in a close battle with a 16:14 score on the first map.

<p>
 Apeks should have banned Vertigo since it’s one of Vitality’s signature maps, but they didn’t do so. Nonetheless, Apeks had a promising start on the map, securing four rounds on the CT side and playing confidently. However, as Vitality regained their economic strength, they started winning rounds consistently, resulting in a 10:5 score in their favor by the end of the first half while playing as terrorists.

 In the second half, Apeks fought hard to prevent Vitality from winning any rounds. Apeks’ losing on this half of the map meant Vitality would advance to the finals, so Apeks rallied and focused on their gameplay. They impressively won five consecutive rounds, equalizing the score to 10:10. Vitality realized they needed to take action and strategized during a pause, which paid off.
</p>
<p>
 They focused on dominating the A site and claimed three consecutive rounds. With a 13:10 score, they were only three rounds away from securing a spot in the final. Their strong teamwork, well-timed pauses to assess the situation, and passionate support from their fans helped Vitality become finalists in the last CS:GO Major.

Nonetheless, Apeks had a promising start on the map, securing four rounds on the CT side and playing confidently. However, as Vitality regained their economic strength, they started winning rounds consistently, resulting in a 10:5 score in their favor by the end of the first half while playing as terrorists.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cblockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"\u003e\n    NAWWK IS POPPIN OFF IN ACCOR ARENA 😮\n    \n     pic.twitter.com/cjpZyIoSDN\n    \n\u003c/p\u003e\n   — Apeks (@apeksgg)\n   \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/apeksgg/status/1660003155579371520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\n    May 20, 2023\n   \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"\u003e\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n In the second half, Apeks fought hard to prevent Vitality from winning any rounds. Apeks’ losing on this half of the map meant Vitality would advance to the finals, so Apeks rallied and focused on their gameplay.
